07.81-09.97`THE BLUE CROSS

11.43-26.35`BETWEEN the silver ribbon of morning and the green glittering ribbon of sea, the boat touched Harwich and let loose a swarm of folk like flies, among whom the man we must follow was by no means conspicuous — nor wished to be. 

35.17`There was nothing notable about him, except a slight contrast between the holiday gaiety of his clothes and the official gravity of his face. 

44.06`His clothes included a slight, pale grey jacket, a white waistcoat, and a silver straw hat with a grey blue ribbon. 

53.77`His lean face was dark by contrast, and ended in a curt black beard that looked Spanish and suggested an Elizabethan ruff. 

58.47`He was smoking a cigarette with the seriousness of an idler. 

1.12.56`There was nothing about him to indicate the fact that the grey jacket covered a loaded revolver, that the white waistcoat covered a police card, or that the straw hat covered one of the most powerful intellects in Europe. 

1.25.58`For this was Valentin himself, the head of the Paris Police and the most famous investigator of the world; and he was coming from Brussels to London to make the greatest arrest of the century. 

1.28.24`Flambeau was in England. 

1.46.59`The police of three countries had tracked the great criminal at last from Ghent to Brussels, from Brussels to the Hook of Holland; and it was conjectured that he would take some advantage of the unfamiliarity and confusion of the Eucharistic Congress, then taking place in London. 

1.59.22`Probably he would travel as some minor clerk or secretary connected with it; but, of course, Valentin could not be certain; nobody could be certain about Flambeau. 

2.13.82`It is many years now since this colossus of crime suddenly ceased keeping the world in a turmoil; and when he ceased, as they said after the death of Roland, there was a great quiet upon the earth. 

2.23.22`But in his best days (I mean, of course, his worst) Flambeau was a figure as statuesque and international as the Kaiser. 

2.31.22`Almost every morning the daily paper announced that he had escaped the consequences of one extraordinary crime by committing another. 

2.53.88`He was a Gascon of gigantic stature and bodily daring; and the wildest tales were told of his outbursts of athletic humour: how he turned the juge d’instruction upside down and stood him on his head, “to clear his mind”, how he ran down the Rue de Rivoli with a policeman under each arm. 

2.47.15`It is due to him to say that his fantastic physical strength was generally employed in such bloodless though undignified scenes; his real crimes were chiefly those of ingen ious and wholesale robbery. 

2.53.18`But each of his thefts was almost a new sin, and would make a story by it self. 

2.58.01`It was he who ran the great Tyrolean Dairy Company in London, with no dairies, no cows, no carts, no milk, but with some thousand subscribers. 

3.06.07`These he served by the simple operation of moving the little milk cans outside people’s doors to the doors of his own customers. 

3.14.07`It was he who had kept up an unaccountable and close correspondence with a young lady whose whole letter bag was inter cepted, by the extraordinary trick of photographing his messages infinitesimally small upon the slides of a microscope. 

3.19.21`A sweeping simplicity, however, marked many of his experiments. 

3.27.02`It is said that he once repainted all the numbers in a street in the dead of night merely to divert one traveller into a trap. 

3.36.98`It is quite certain that he invented a portable pillar box, which he put up at corners in quiet sub urbs on the chance of strangers dropping postal or ders into it. 

3.47.84`Lastly, he was known to be a startling acrobat; despite his huge figure, he could leap like a grasshopper and melt into the tree tops like a monkey. 

3.58.85`Hence the great Valentin, when he set out to find Flambeau, was perfectly aware that his adventures would not end when he had found him. 

4.06.38`But how was he to find him? On this the great Valentin’s ideas were still in process of settlement. 

4.15.39`There was one thing which Flambeau, with all his dexterity of disguise, could not cover, and that was his singular height. 

4.24.85`If Valentin’s quick eye had caught a tall apple woman, a tall grenadier, or even a tolerably tall duchess, he might have arrested them on the spot. 

4.32.47`But all along his train there was nobody that could be a disguised Flambeau, any more than a cat could be a disguised giraffe. 

4.43.90`About the people on the boat he had already satisfied him self; and the people picked up at Harwich or on the journey limited themselves with certainty to six. 

4.53.45`There was a short railway official travelling up to the terminus, three fairly short market gardeners picked up two stations afterwards, one very short widow lady going up from a small Essex town, and a very short Roman Catholic priest going up from a small Essex village. 

When it came to the last case, Valentin gave it up and almost laughed. 

The little priest was so much the essence of those Eastern flats; he had a face as round and dull as a Norfolk dumpling; he had eyes as empty as the North Sea; he had several brown paper parcels, which he was quite incapable of collecting. 

The Eucharistic Con gress had doubtless sucked out of their local stagna tion many such creatures, blind and helpless, like moles disinterred. 

Valentin was a sceptic in the severe style of France, and could have no love for priests. 

But he could have pity for them, and this one might have provoked pity in anybody. 

He had a large, shabby umbrella, which constantly fell on the floor. 

He did not seem to know which was the right end of his return ticket. 

He explained with a moon calf simplicity to everybody in the carriage that he had to be careful, because he had something made of real silver “with blue stones” in one of his brown paper parcels. 

His quaint blending of Essex flatness with saintly simplicity continuously amused the Frenchman till the priest arrived (somehow) at Tot tenham with all his parcels, and came back for his umbrella. 

When he did the last, Valentin even had the good nature to warn him not to take care of the silver by telling everybody about it. 

But to whom ever he talked, Valentin kept his eye open for some one else; he looked out steadily for anyone, rich or poor, male or female, who was well up to six feet; for Flambeau was four inches above it. 

He alighted at Liverpool Street, however, quite conscientiously secure that he had not missed the criminal so far. 

He then went to Scotland Yard to regularise his position and arrange for help in case of need; he then lit another cigarette and went for a long stroll in the streets of London. 

As he was walk ing in the streets and squares beyond Victoria, he paused suddenly and stood. 

It was a quaint, quiet square, very typical of London, full of an accidental stillness. 

The tall, flat houses round looked at once prosperous and uninhabited; the square of shrub bery in the centre looked as deserted as a green Pa cific islet. 

One of the four sides was much higher than the rest, like a dais; and the line of this side was broken by one of London’s admirable accidents — a restaurant that looked as if it had strayed from Soho. 

It was an unreasonably attractive object, with dwarf plants in pots and long, striped blinds of lemon yellow and white. 

It stood specially high above the street, and in the usual patchwork way of London, a flight of steps from the street ran up to meet the front door almost as a fire escape might run up to a first floor window. 

Valentin stood and smoked in front of the yellow white blinds and considered them long. 

 The most incredible thing about miracles is that they happen. 

A few clouds in heaven do come to gether into the staring shape of one human eye. 

A tree does stand up in the landscape of a doubtful journey in the exact and elaborate shape of a note of interrogation. 

I have seen both these things myself within the last few days. 

Nelson does die in the in stant of victory; and a man named Williams does quite accidentally murder a man named Williamson; it sounds like a sort of infanticide. 

In short, there is in life an element of elfin coincidence which people reckoning on the prosaic may perpetually miss. 

As it  has been well expressed in the paradox of Poe, wisdom should reckon on the unforeseen. 

Aristide Valentin was unfathomably French; and the French intelligence is intelligence specially and solely. 

He was not “a thinking machine”; for that is a brainless phrase of modern fatalism and materialism. 

A machine only is a machine because it cannot think. 

But he was a thinking man, and a plain man at the same time. 

All his wonderful successes, that looked like conjuring, had been gained by plodding logic, by clear and commonplace French thought. 

The French electrify the world not by starting any paradox, they electrify it by carrying out a truism. 

They carry a truism so far — as in the French Revo lution1. 

But exactly because Valentin understood reason, he understood the limits of reason. 

Only a man who knows nothing of motors talks of motor ing without petrol; only a man who knows nothing of reason talks of reasoning without strong, undis puted first principles. 

Here he had no strong first principles. 

Flambeau had been missed at Harwich; and if he was in London at all, he might be anything from a tall tramp on Wimbledon Common to a tall toast master at the Hotel Metropole. 

In such a naked state of nescience, Valentin had a view and a method of his own. 

In such cases he reckoned on the unforeseen. 

In such cases, when he could not follow the train of the reasonable, he coldly and carefully followed the train of the unreasonable. 

Instead of going to the right places — banks, police stations, rendezvous — he systematically went to the wrong places; knocked at every empty house, turned down every cul de sac, went up every lane blocked with rubbish, went round every crescent that led him uselessly out of the way. 

He defended this crazy course quite logical ly. 

He said that if one had a clue this was the worst way; but if one had no clue at all it was the best, be cause there was just the chance that any oddity that caught the eye of the pursuer might be the same that had caught the eye of the pursued. 

Somewhere a man must begin, and it had better be just where another man might stop. 

Something about that flight of steps up to the shop, something about the quietude and quaintness of the restaurant, roused all the detective’s rare romantic fancy and made him resolve to strike at random1. 

He went up the steps, and sitting down at a table by the window, asked for a cup of black coffee. 

 It was half way through the morning, and he had not breakfasted; the slight litter of other breakfasts stood about on the table to remind him of his hunger; and adding a poached egg to his order, he pro ceeded musingly to shake some white sugar into his coffee, thinking all the time about Flambeau. 

He re membered how Flambeau had escaped, once by a pair of nail scissors, and once by a house on fire; once by having to pay for an unstamped letter, and once by getting people to look through a telescope at a comet that might destroy the world. 

He thought his detective brain as good as the criminal’s, which was true. 

But he fully realised the disadvantage. 

“The criminal is the creative artist; the detective only the critic,” he said with a sour smile, and lifted his coffee cup to his lips slowly, and put it down very quickly. 

He had put salt in it. 

 He looked at the vessel from which the silvery powder had come; it was certainly a sugar basin; as unmistakably meant for sugar as a champagne bottle for champagne. 

He wondered why they should keep salt in it. 

He looked to see if there were any more orthodox vessels. 

Yes; there were two salt cellars quite full. 

Perhaps there was some speciality in the condiment in the salt cellars. 

He tasted it; it was sugar. 

Then he looked round at the restaurant with a refreshed air of interest, to see if there were any other traces of that singular artistic taste which puts the sugar in the salt cellars and the salt in the sugar basin. 

Except for an odd splash of some dark fluid on one of the white papered walls, the whole place appeared neat, cheerful and ordinary. 

He rang the bell for the waiter. 

When that official hurried up, fuzzy haired and somewhat blear eyed at that early hour, the detec tive (who was not without an appreciation of the simple forms of humour) asked him to taste the sugar and see if it was up to the high reputation of the hotel. 

The result was that the waiter yawned suddenly and woke up. 

“Do you play this delicate joke on your customers every morning?” inquired Valentin. 

“Does changing the salt and sugar never pall on you as a jest?” The waiter, when this irony grew clearer, stam meringly assured him that the establishment had certainly no such intention; it must be a most curious mistake. 

He picked up the sugar basin and looked at it; he picked up the salt cellar and looked at that, his face growing more and more bewildered. 

At last he abruptly excused himself, and hurrying away, returned in a few seconds with the proprietor. 

The proprietor also examined the sugar basin and then the salt cellar; the proprietor also looked be wildered. 

Suddenly the waiter seemed to grow inarticulate with a rush of words. 

“I zink,” he stuttered eagerly, “I zink it is those two clergymen.” “What two clergymen?” “The two clergymen,” said the waiter, “that threw soup at the wall.” “Threw soup at the wall?” repeated Valentin, feeling sure this must be some singular Italian metaphor. 

“Yes, yes,” said the attendant excitedly, and pointed at the dark splash on the white paper; “threw it over there on the wall.” Valentin looked his query at the proprietor, who came to his rescue with fuller reports. 

“Yes, sir,” he said, “it’s quite true, though I don’t suppose it has anything to do with the sugar and salt. 

Two clergymen came in and drank soup here very early, as soon as the shutters were taken down. 

They were both very quiet, respectable people; one of them paid the bill and went out; the other, who seemed a slower coach1 altogether, was some minutes longer getting his things together. 

But he went at last. 

Only, the instant before he stepped into the street he deliberately picked up his cup, which he had only half emptied, and threw the a slower coach —  soup slap on the wall. 

I was in the back room my self, and so was the waiter; so I could only rush out in time to find the wall splashed and the shop empty. 

It don’t do any particular damage, but it was confounded cheek; and I tried to catch the men in the street. 

They were too far off though; I only noticed they went round the next corner into Carstairs Street.” The detective was on his feet, hat settled and stick in hand. 

He had already decided that in the universal darkness of his mind he could only follow the first odd finger that pointed; and this finger was odd enough. 

Paying his bill and clashing the glass doors behind him, he was soon swinging round into the other street. 

 It was fortunate that even in such fevered mo ments his eye was cool and quick. 

Something in a shop front went by him like a mere flash; yet he went back to look at it. 

The shop was a popular greengrocery and fruiterer’s, an array of goods set out in the open air and plainly ticketed with their names and prices. 

In the two most prominent com partments were two heaps, of oranges and of nuts respectively. 

On the heap of nuts lay a scrap of card board, on which was written in bold, blue chalk, “Best tangerine oranges, two a penny.” On the or anges was the equally clear and exact description, “Finest Brazil nuts, 4d. 

a lb.” Valentin looked at  these two placards and fancied he had met this highly subtle form of humour before, and that somewhat recently. 

He drew the attention of the red faced fruiterer, who was looking rather sullenly up and down the street, to this inaccuracy in his ad vertisements. 

The fruiterer said nothing, but sharp ly put each card into its proper place. 

The detective, leaning elegantly on his walking cane, continued to scrutinise the shop. 

At last he said, “Pray excuse my apparent irrelevance, my good sir, but I should like to ask you a question in experimental psychology and the association of ideas.” The red faced shopman regarded him with an eye of menace; but he continued gaily, swinging his cane, “Why,” he pursued, “why are two tickets wrongly placed in a greengrocer’s shop like a shovel hat that has come to London for a holiday? Or, in case I do not make myself clear, what is the mystical association which connects the idea of nuts marked as oranges with the idea of two clergymen, one tall and the other short?” The eyes of the tradesman stood out of his head like a snail’s; he really seemed for an instant likely to fling himself upon the stranger. 

At last he stam mered angrily: “I don’t know what you ’ave to do with it, but if you’re one of their friends, you can tell ’em from me that I’ll knock their silly ’eads off, par sons or no parsons, if they upset my apples again.” “Indeed?” asked the detective, with great sympa thy. 

“Did they upset your apples?” “One of ’em did,” said the heated shopman; “rolled ’em all over the street. 

I’d ’ave caught the fool but for havin’ to pick ’em up.” “Which way did these parsons go?” asked Valentin. 

“Up that second road on the left hand side, and then across the square,” said the other promptly. 

“Thanks,” replied Valentin, and vanished like a fairy. 

On the other side of the second square he found a policeman, and said: “This is urgent, con stable; have you seen two clergymen in shovel hats?” The policeman began to chuckle heavily. 

“I ’ave, sir; and if you arst me, one of ’em was drunk. 

He stood in the middle of the road that bewildered that — ” “Which way did they go?” snapped Valentin. 

“They took one of them yellow buses over there,” answered the man; “them that go to Hampstead.” Valentin produced his official card and said very rapidly: “Call up two of your men to come with me in pursuit,” and crossed the road with such conta gious energy that the ponderous policeman was moved to almost agile obedience. 

In a minute and a half the French detective was joined on the opposite pavement by an inspector and a man in plain clothes. 

“Well, sir,” began the former, with smiling im portance, “and what may — ?”  Valentin pointed suddenly with his cane. 

“I’ll tell you on the top of that omnibus,” he said, and was darting and dodging across the tangle of the traffic. 

When all three sank panting on the top seats of the yellow vehicle, the inspector said: “We could go four times as quick in a taxi.” “Quite true,” replied their leader placidly, “if we only had an idea of where we were going.” “Well, where are you going?” asked the other, staring. 

Valentin smoked frowningly for a few seconds; then, removing his cigarette, he said: “If you know what a man’s doing, get in front of him; but if you want to guess what he’s doing, keep behind him. 

Stray when he strays; stop when he stops; travel as slowly as he. 

Then you may see what he saw and may act as he acted. 

All we can do is to keep our eyes skinned for a queer thing.” “What sort of queer thing do you mean?” asked the inspector. 

“Any sort of queer thing,” answered Valentin, and relapsed into obstinate silence. 

The yellow omnibus crawled up the northern roads for what seemed like hours on end1; the great detective would not explain further, and perhaps his assistants felt a silent and growing doubt of his errand. 

 Perhaps, also, they felt a silent and growing desire for lunch, for the hours crept long past the normal luncheon hour, and the long roads of the North London suburbs seemed to shoot out into length af ter length like an infernal telescope. 

It was one of those journeys on which a man perpetually feels that now at last he must have come to the end of the universe, and then finds he has only come to the be ginning of Tufnell Park. 

London died away in drag gled taverns and dreary scrubs, and then was unac countably born again in blazing high streets and blatant hotels. 

It was like passing through thirteen separate vulgar cities all just touching each other. 

But though the winter twilight was already threat ening the road ahead of them, the Parisian detective still sat silent and watchful, eyeing the frontage of the streets that slid by on either side. 

By the time they had left Camden Town behind, the policemen were nearly asleep; at least, they gave something like a jump as Valentin leapt erect, struck a hand on each man’s shoulder, and shouted to the driver to stop. 

They tumbled down the steps into the road with out realising why they had been dislodged; when they looked round for enlightenment they found Valentin triumphantly pointing his finger towards a window on the left side of the road. 

It was a large window, forming part of the long façade of a gilt and palatial public house; it was the part reserved  for respectable dining, and labelled “Restaurant.” This window, like all the rest along the frontage of the hotel, was of frosted and figured glass; but in the middle of it was a big, black smash, like a star in the ice. 

“Our cue at last,” cried Valentin, waving his stick; “the place with the broken window.” “What window? What cue?” asked his principal assistant. 

“Why, what proof is there that this has any thing to do with them?” Valentin almost broke his bamboo stick with rage. 

“Proof!” he cried. 

“Good God! the man is looking for proof! Why, of course, the chances are twenty to one that it has nothing to do with them. 

But what else can we do? Don’t you see we must either follow one wild possibility or else go home to bed?” He banged his way into the restaurant, followed by his companions, and they were soon seated at a late luncheon at a little table, and looked at the star of smashed glass from the inside. 

Not that it was very informative to them even then. 

“Got your window broken, I see,” said Valentin to the waiter as he paid the bill. 

“Yes, sir,” answered the attendant, bending busily over the change, to which Valentin silently added an enormous tip. 

The waiter straightened himself with mild but unmistakable animation. 

“Ah, yes, sir,” he said. 

“Very odd thing, that, sir.” “Indeed? Tell us about it,” said the detective with careless curiosity. 

“Well, two gents in black came in,” said the wait er; “two of those foreign parsons that are running about. 

They had a cheap and quiet little lunch, and one of them paid for it and went out. 

The other was just going out to join him when I looked at my change again and found he’d paid me more than three times too much. 

‘Here,’ I say to the chap who was nearly out of the door, ‘you’ve paid too much.’ ‘Oh,’ he says, very cool, ‘have we?’ ‘Yes,’ I says, and picks up the bill to show him. 

Well, that was a knock out.” “What do you mean?” asked his interlocutor. 

“Well, I’d have sworn on seven Bibles that I’d put 4s. 

on that bill. 

But now I saw I’d put 14s., as plain as paint.” “Well?” cried Valentin, moving slowly, but with burning eyes, “and then?” “The parson at the door he says all serene, ‘Sorry to confuse your accounts, but it’ll pay for the win dow.’ ‘What window?’ I says. 

‘The one I’m going to break,’ he says, and smashed that blessed pane with his umbrella.” All three inquirers made an exclamation; and the inspector said under his breath, “Are we after es caped lunatics?” The waiter went on with some rel ish for the ridiculous story:  “I was so knocked silly for a second, I couldn’t do anything. 

The man marched out of the place and joined his friend just round the corner. 

Then they went so quick up Bullock Street that I couldn’t catch them, though I ran round the bars to do it.” “Bullock Street,” said the detective, and shot up that thoroughfare as quickly as the strange couple he pursued. 

Their journey now took them through bare brick ways like tunnels; streets with few lights and even with few windows; streets that seemed built out of the blank backs of everything and everywhere. 

Dusk was deepening, and it was not easy even for the London policemen to guess in what exact direc tion they were treading. 

The inspector, however, was pretty certain that they would eventually strike some part of Hampstead Heath. 

Abruptly one bulg ing gas lit window broke the blue twilight like a bull’s eye lantern; and Valentin stopped an instant before a little garish sweetstuff shop. 

After an in stant’s hesitation he went in; he stood amid the gaudy colours of the confectionery with entire gravi ty and bought thirteen chocolate cigars with a certain care. 

He was clearly preparing an opening; but he did not need one. 

An angular, elderly young woman in the shop had regarded his elegant appearance with a merely automatic inquiry; but when she saw the door be 21G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON hind him blocked with the blue uniform of the in spector, her eyes seemed to wake up. 

“Oh,” she said, “if you’ve come about that parcel, I’ve sent it off already.” “Parcel?” repeated Valentin; and it was his turn to look inquiring. 

“I mean the parcel the gentleman left — the cler gyman gentleman.” “For goodness’ sake,” said Valentin, leaning for ward with his first real confession of eagerness, “for Heaven’s sake tell us what happened exactly.” “Well,” said the woman a little doubtfully, “the clergymen came in about half an hour ago and bought some peppermints and talked a bit, and then went off towards the Heath. 

But a second after, one of them runs back into the shop and says, ‘Have I left a parcel?’ Well, I looked everywhere and couldn’t see one; so he says, ‘Never mind; but if it should turn up, please post it to this address,’ and he left me the address and a shilling for my trouble1. 

And sure enough, though I thought I’d looked everywhere, I found he’d left a brown paper parcel, so I posted it to the place he said. 

I can’t remember the address now; it was somewhere in Westminster. 

But as the thing seemed so important, I thought perhaps the police had come about it.” 1 22 for my trouble — (зд.) за хлопоты1 “So they have,” said Valentin shortly. 

“Is Hamp stead Heath near here?” “Straight on for fifteen minutes,” said the wom an, “and you’ll come right out on the open.” Valen tin sprang out of the shop and began to run. 

The other detectives followed him at a reluctant trot. 

The street they threaded was so narrow and shut in by shadows that when they came out unexpected ly into the void common and vast sky they were startled to find the evening still so light and clear. 

A perfect dome of peacock green sank into gold amid the blackening trees and the dark violet dis tances. 

The glowing green tint was just deep enough to pick out in points of crystal one or two stars. 

All that was left of the daylight lay in a golden glitter across the edge of Hampstead and that popular hol low which is called the Vale of Health. 

The holiday makers who roam this region had not wholly dis persed; a few couples sat shapelessly on benches; and here and there a distant girl still shrieked in one of the swings. 

The glory of heaven deepened and darkened around the sublime vulgarity of man; and standing on the slope and looking across the valley, Valentin beheld the thing which he sought. 

Among the black and breaking groups in that distance was one especially black which did not break — a group of two figures clerically clad1. 

clerically clad — в церковном облачении 23G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 24 Though they seemed as small as insects, Valentin could see that one of them was much smaller than the other. 

Though the other had a student’s stoop and an inconspicuous manner, he could see that the man was well over six feet high. 

He shut his teeth and went forward, whirling his stick impatiently. 

By the time he had substantially diminished the distance and magnified the two black figures as in a vast micro scope, he had perceived something else; something which startled him, and yet which he had somehow expected. 

Whoever was the tall priest, there could be no doubt about the identity of the short one. 

It was his friend of the Harwich train, the stumpy little curXe of Essex whom he had warned about his brown paper parcels. 

Now, so far as this went, everything fitted in fi nally and rationally enough. 

Valentin had learned by his inquiries that morning that Father Brown from Essex was bringing up a silver cross with sap phires, a relic of considerable value, to show some of the foreign priests at the congress. 

This undoubt edly was the “silver with blue stones”; and Father Brown undoubtedly was the little greenhorn in the train. 

Now there was nothing wonderful about the fact that what Valentin had found out Flambeau had also found out; Flambeau found out everything. 

Also there was nothing wonderful in the fact that when Flambeau heard of a sapphire cross he should  try to steal it; that was the most natural thing in all natural history. 

And most certainly there was noth ing wonderful about the fact that Flambeau should have it all his own way with such a silly sheep as the man with the umbrella and the parcels. 

He was the sort of man whom anybody could lead on a string to the North Pole; it was not surprising that an actor like Flambeau, dressed as another priest, could lead him to Hampstead Heath. 

So far the crime seemed clear enough; and while the detective pitied the priest for his helplessness, he almost despised Flam beau for condescending to so gullible a victim. 

But when Valentin thought of all that had happened in between, of all that had led him to his triumph, he racked his brains for the smallest rhyme or reason in it. 

What had the stealing of a blue and silver cross from a priest from Essex to do with chucking soup at wall paper? What had it to do with calling nuts oranges, or with paying for windows first and breaking them afterwards? He had come to the end of his chase; yet somehow he had missed the middle of it. 

When he failed (which was seldom), he had usually grasped the clue, but nevertheless missed the criminal. 

Here he had grasped the criminal, but still he could not grasp the clue. 

The two figures that they followed were crawling like black flies across the huge green contour of a hill. 

They were evidently sunk in conversation, and 25G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 26 perhaps did not notice where they were going; but they were certainly going to the wilder and more si lent heights of the Heath. 

As their pursuers gained on them, the latter had to use the undignified atti tudes of the deer stalker, to crouch behind clumps of trees and even to crawl prostrate in deep grass. 

By these ungainly ingenuities the hunters even came close enough to the quarry to hear the mur mur of the discussion, but no word could be distin guished except the word “reason” recurring fre quently in a high and almost childish voice. 

Once over an abrupt dip of land and a dense tangle of thickets, the detectives actually lost the two figures they were following. 

They did not find the trail again for an agonising ten minutes, and then it led round the brow of a great dome of hill overlooking an amphitheatre of rich and desolate sunset scenery. 

Under a tree in this commanding yet neglected spot was an old ramshackle wooden seat. 

On this seat sat the two priests still in serious speech together. 

The gorgeous green and gold still clung to the darkening horizon; but the dome above was turning slowly from peacock green to peacock blue, and the stars detached themselves more and more like solid jewels. 

Mutely motioning to his followers, Valentin contrived to creep up behind the big branching tree, and, standing there in deathly silence, heard the words of the strange priests for the first time. 

 After he had listened for a minute and a half, he was gripped by a devilish doubt. 

Perhaps he had dragged the two English policemen to the wastes of a nocturnal heath on an errand no saner than seek ing figs on its thistles1. 

For the two priests were talking exactly like priests, piously, with learning and leisure, about the most aerial enigmas of theol ogy. 

The little Essex priest spoke the more simply, with his round face turned to the strengthening stars; the other talked with his head bowed, as if he were not even worthy to look at them. 

But no more innocently clerical conversation could have been heard in any white Italian cloister or black Spanish cathedral. 

The first he heard was the tail of one of Father Brown’s sentences, which ended: “. 

. 

. 

what they re ally meant in the Middle Ages by the heavens being incorruptible.” The taller priest nodded his bowed head and said: “Ah, yes, these modern infidels appeal to their reason; but who can look at those millions of worlds and not feel that there may well be wonderful uni verses above us where reason is utterly unreason able?” 1 seeking figs on its thistles — (ср.

CHESTERTON 28 “No,” said the other priest; “reason is always rea sonable, even in the last limbo, in the lost border land of things. 

I know that people charge the Church with lowering reason, but it is just the other way. 

Alone on earth, the Church makes reason real ly supreme. 

Alone on earth, the Church affirms that God himself is bound by reason.” The other priest raised his austere face to the spangled sky and said: “Yet who knows if in that infinite universe — ?” “Only infinite physically,” said the little priest, turning sharply in his seat, “not infinite in the sense of escaping from the laws of truth.” Valentin behind his tree was tearing his finger nails with silent fury. 

He seemed almost to hear the sniggers of the English detectives whom he had brought so far on a fantastic guess only to listen to the metaphysical gossip of two mild old parsons. 

In his impatience he lost the equally elaborate answer of the tall cleric, and when he listened again it was again Father Brown who was speaking: “Reason and justice grip the remotest and the loneliest star. 

Look at those stars. 

Don’t they look as if they were single diamonds and sapphires? Well, you can imagine any mad botany or geology you please. 

Think of forests of adamant with leaves of brilliants. 

Think that the moon is a blue moon, a single elephantine sapphire. 

But don’t fancy that all  that frantic astronomy would make the smallest dif ference to the reason and justice of conduct. 

On plains of opal, under cliffs cut out of pearl, you would still find a notice board, ‘Thou shalt not steal.’1” Valentin was just in the act of rising from his rig id and crouching attitude and creeping away as soft ly as might be, felled by the one great folly of his life. 

But something in the very silence of the tall priest made him stop until the latter spoke. 

When at last he did speak, he said simply, his head bowed and his hands on his knees: “Well, I think that other worlds may perhaps rise higher than our reason. 

The mystery of heaven is unfathomable, and I for one can only bow my head.” Then, with brow yet bent and without changing by the faintest shade his attitude or voice, he added: “Just hand over that sapphire cross of yours, will you? We’re all alone here, and I could pull you to pieces like a straw doll.” The utterly unaltered voice and attitude added a strange violence to that shocking change of speech. 

But the guarder of the relic only seemed to turn his head by the smallest section of the compass. 

He seemed still to have a somewhat foolish face 1 Thou shalt not steal — библейская заповедь «не ук ради» 29G.

CHESTERTON 30 turned to the stars. 

Perhaps he had not understood. 

Or, perhaps, he had understood and sat rigid with terror. 

“Yes,” said the tall priest, in the same low voice and in the same still posture, “yes, I am Flambeau.” Then, after a pause, he said: “Come, will you give me that cross?” “No,” said the other, and the monosyllable had an odd sound. 

Flambeau suddenly flung off all his pontifical pretensions. 

The great robber leaned back in his seat and laughed low but long. 

“No,” he cried, “you won’t give it me, you proud prelate. 

You won’t give it me, you little celibate simpleton. 

Shall I tell you why you won’t give it me? Because I’ve got it already in my own breast pocket.” The small man from Essex turned what seemed to be a dazed face in the dusk, and said, with the timid eagerness of “The Private Secretary”: “Are — are you sure?” Flambeau yelled with delight. 

“Really, you’re as good as a three act farce,” he cried. 

“Yes, you turnip, I am quite sure. 

I had the sense to make a duplicate of the right parcel, and now, my friend, you’ve got the duplicate and I’ve got the jewels. 

An old dodge, Father Brown — a very old dodge.”1 2 “Yes,” said Father Brown, and passed his hand through his hair with the same strange vagueness of manner. 

“Yes, I’ve heard of it before.” The colossus of crime leaned over to the little rustic priest with a sort of sudden interest. 

“You have heard of it?” he asked. 

“Where have you heard of it?” “Well, I mustn’t tell you his name, of course,” said the little man simply. 

“He was a penitent, you know. 

He had lived prosperously for about twenty years entirely on duplicate brown paper parcels. 

And so, you see, when I began to suspect you, I thought of this poor chap’s way of doing it at once.” “Began to suspect me?” repeated the outlaw with increased intensity. 

“Did you really have the gump tion to suspect me just because I brought you up to this bare part of the heath?” “No, no,” said Brown with an air of apology. 

“You see, I suspected you when we first met. 

It’s that little bulge up the sleeve where you people have the spiked bracelet1.” “How in Tartarus,” cried Flambeau, “did you ever hear of the spiked bracelet?” “Oh, one’s little flock2, you know!” said Father Brown, arching his eyebrows rather blankly. 

“When spiked bracele — (зд.) наручники little flock — (зд.) паства, прихожане 31G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 32 I was a curate in Hartlepool, there were three of them with spiked bracelets. 

So, as I suspected you from the first, don’t you see, I made sure that the cross should go safe, anyhow. 

I’m afraid I watched you, you know. 

So at last I saw you change the par cels. 

Then, don’t you see, I changed them back again. 

And then I left the right one behind.” “Left it behind?” repeated Flambeau, and for the first time there was another note in his voice beside his triumph. 

“Well, it was like this,” said the little priest, speaking in the same unaffected way. 

“I went back to that sweet shop and asked if I’d left a parcel, and gave them a particular address if it turned up. 

Well, I knew I hadn’t; but when I went away again I did. 

So, instead of running after me with that valuable parcel, they have sent it flying to a friend of mine in Westminster.” Then he added rather sadly: “I learnt that, too, from a poor fellow in Hartlepool. 

He used to do it with handbags he stole at railway stations, but he’s in a monastery now. 

Oh, one gets to know, you know,” he added, rubbing his head again with the same sort of desperate apology. 

“We can’t help being priests. 

People come and tell us these things.” Flambeau tore a brown paper parcel out of his inner pocket and rent it in pieces. 

There was noth ing but paper and sticks of lead inside it. 

He sprang to his feet with a gigantic gesture, and cried:  “I don’t believe you. 

I don’t believe a bumpkin like you could manage all that. 

I believe you’ve still got the stuff on you, and if you don’t give it up — why, we’re all alone, and I’ll take it by force!” “No,” said Father Brown simply, and stood up also, “you won’t take it by force. 

First, because I re ally haven’t still got it. 

And, second, because we are not alone.” Flambeau stopped in his stride forward. 

“Behind that tree,” said Father Brown, pointing, “are two strong policemen and the greatest detective alive. 

How did they come here, do you ask? Why, I brought them, of course! How did I do it? Why, I’ll tell you if you like! Lord bless you, we have to know twenty such things when we work among the crimi nal classes! Well, I wasn’t sure you were a thief, and it would never do to make a scandal against one of our own clergy. 

So I just tested you to see if any thing would make you show yourself. 

A man gener ally makes a small scene if he finds salt in his coffee; if he doesn’t, he has some reason for keeping quiet. 

I changed the salt and sugar, and you kept quiet. 

A man generally objects if his bill is three times too big. 

If he pays it, he has some motive for passing un noticed. 

I altered your bill, and you paid it.” The world seemed waiting for Flambeau to leap like a tiger. 

But he was held back as by a spell; he was stunned with the utmost curiosity. 

33G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 34 “Well,” went on Father Brown, with lumbering lucidity, “as you wouldn’t leave any tracks for the police, of course somebody had to. 

At every place we went to, I took care to do something that would get us talked about for the rest of the day. 

I didn’t do much harm — a splashed wall, spilt apples, a broken window; but I saved the cross, as the cross will al ways be saved. 

It is at Westminster by now. 

I rather wonder you didn’t stop it with the Donkey’s Whistle.” “With the what?” asked Flambeau. 

“I’m glad you’ve never heard of it,” said the priest, making a face. 

“It’s a foul thing. 

I’m sure you’re too good a man for a Whistle. 

I couldn’t have countered it even with the Spots myself; I’m not strong enough in the legs.” “What on earth are you talking about?” asked the other. 

“Well, I did think you’d know the Spots,” said Father Brown, agreeably surprised. 

“Oh, you can’t have gone so very wrong yet!” “How in blazes do you know all these horrors?” cried Flambeau. 

The shadow of a smile crossed the round, simple face of his clerical opponent. 

“Oh, by being a celibate simpleton, I suppose,” he said. 

“Has it never struck you that a man who does next to nothing but hear men’s real sins is not likely to be wholly unaware of human evil? But, as a1 mon ami — (фр.) друг мой matter of fact, another part of my trade, too, made me sure you weren’t a priest.” “What?” asked the thief, almost gaping. 

“You attacked reason,” said Father Brown. 

“It’s bad theology.” And even as he turned away to collect his prop erty, the three policemen came out from under the twilight trees. 

Flambeau was an artist and a sports man. 

He stepped back and swept Valentin a great bow. 

“Do not bow to me, mon ami1,” said Valentin with silver clearness. 

“Let us both bow to our mas ter.” And they both stood an instant uncovered while the little Essex priest blinked about for his umbrella.The Secret Garden A RISTIDE Valentin, Chief of the Paris Police, was late for his dinner, and some of his guests began to arrive before him. 

These were, how ever, reassured by his confidential servant, Ivan, the old man with a scar, and a face almost as grey as his moustaches, who always sat at a table in the en trance hall — a hall hung with weapons. 

Valentin’s house was perhaps as peculiar and celebrated as its master. 

It was an old house, with high walls and tall poplars almost overhanging the Seine; but the oddi ty — and perhaps the police value — of its architec ture was this: that there was no ultimate exit at all except through this front door, which was guarded by Ivan and the armoury. 

The garden was large and elaborate, and there were many exits from the house into the garden. 

But there was no exit from the gar den into the world outside; all round it ran a tall, smooth, unscalable wall with special spikes at the top; no bad garden, perhaps, for a man to reflect in whom some hundred criminals had sworn to kill. 

36THE SECRET GARDEN As Ivan explained to the guests, their host had telephoned that he was detained for ten minutes. 

He was, in truth, making some last arrangements about executions and such ugly things; and though these duties were rootedly repulsive to him, he always performed them with precision. 

Ruthless in the pur suit of criminals, he was very mild about their pun ishment. 

Since he had been supreme over French — and largely over European — policial methods, his great influence had been honourably used for the mitigation of sentences and the purification of pris ons. 

He was one of the great humanitarian French freethinkers; and the only thing wrong with them is that they make mercy even colder than justice. 

When Valentin arrived he was already dressed in black clothes and the red rosette — an elegant figure, his dark beard already streaked with grey. 

He went straight through his house to his study, which opened on the grounds behind. 

The garden door of it was open, and after he had carefully locked his box in its official place, he stood for a few seconds at the open door looking out upon the garden. 

A sharp moon was fighting with the flying rags and tatters of a storm, and Valentin regarded it with a wistfulness unusual in such scientific natures as his. 

Perhaps such scientific natures have some psychic prevision of the most tremendous problem of their lives. 

From any such occult mood, at least, he quickly recov 37G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON ered, for he knew he was late, and that his guests had already begun to arrive. 

A glance at his draw ing room when he entered it was enough to make certain that his principal guest was not there, at any rate. 

He saw all the other pillars of the little party; he saw Lord Galloway, the English Ambassador — a choleric old man with a russet face like an apple, wearing the blue ribbon of the Garter1. 

He saw Lady Galloway, slim and threadlike, with silver hair and a face sensitive and superior. 

He saw her daughter, Lady Margaret Graham, a pale and pretty girl with an elfish face and copper coloured hair. 

He saw the Duchess of Mont St. 

Michel, black eyed and opu lent, and with her her two daughters, black eyed and opulent also. 

He saw Dr. 

Simon, a typical French scientist, with glasses, a pointed brown beard, and a forehead barred with those parallel wrinkles which are the penalty of superciliousness, since they come through constantly elevating the eyebrows. 

He saw Father Brown, of Cobhole, in Es sex, whom he had recently met in England. 

He saw — perhaps with more interest than any of these — a tall man in uniform, who had bowed to the Gallo ways without receiving any very hearty acknowledg ment, and who now advanced alone to pay his re 1 the Garter — Орден Подвязки — высшая награда Британской империи, введенная Эдуардом III около 1348 г. 

38THE SECRET GARDEN spects to his host. 

This was Commandant O’Brien, of the French Foreign Legion1. 

He was a slim yet somewhat swaggering figure, clean shaven, dark haired, and blue eyed, and, as seemed natural in an officer of that famous regiment of victorious fail ures and successful suicides, he had an air at once dashing and melancholy. 

He was by birth an Irish gentleman, and in boyhood had known the Gallo ways — especially Margaret Graham. 

He had left his country after some crash of debts, and now ex pressed his complete freedom from British etiquette by swinging about in uniform, sabre and spurs. 

When he bowed to the Ambassador’s family, Lord and Lady Galloway bent stiffly, and Lady Margaret looked away. 

But for whatever old causes such people might be interested in each other, their distinguished host was not specially interested in them. 

No one of them at least was in his eyes the guest of the evening. 

Val entin was expecting, for special reasons, a man of world wide fame, whose friendship he had secured during some of his great detective tours and tri umphs in the United States. 

He was expecting Julius K. 

Brayne, that multi millionaire whose colossal 1 French Foreign Legion — Иностранный легион — наемные военные формирования (с XIX в.), использова лись для ведения военных действий за пределами Франции 39G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON and even crushing endowments of small religions have occasioned so much easy sport and easier so lemnity for the American and English papers. 

No body could quite make out whether Mr. 

Brayne was an atheist or a Mormon or a Christian Scientist; but he was ready to pour money into any intellectual vessel, so long as it was an untried vessel. 

One of his hobbies was to wait for the American Shake speare — a hobby more patient than angling. 

He ad mired Walt Whitman1, but thought that Luke P. 

Tan ner, of Paris, Pa.2, was more “progressive” than Whit man any day. 

He liked anything that he thought “progressive.” He thought Valentin “progressive,” thereby doing him a grave injustice. 

The solid appearance of Julius K. 

Brayne in the room was as decisive as a dinner bell. 

He had this great quality, which very few of us can claim, that his presence was as big as his absence. 

He was a huge fellow, as fat as he was tall, clad in complete evening black, without so much relief as a watch chain or a ring. 

His hair was white and well brushed back like a German’s; his face was red, fierce and cherubic, with one dark tuft under the lower lip that threw up that otherwise infantile visage with an 1 Walt Whitman — Уолт Уитмен (1819–1892), амери канский поэт 2 Pa.

Not long, however, did that salon merely stare at the celebrated American; his lateness had already be come a domestic problem, and he was sent with all speed into the dining room with Lady Galloway on his arm. 

Except on one point the Galloways were genial and casual enough. 

So long as Lady Margaret did not take the arm of that adventurer O’Brien, her fa ther was quite satisfied; and she had not done so, she had decorously gone in with Dr. 

Simon. 

Never theless, old Lord Galloway was restless and almost rude. 

He was diplomatic enough during dinner, but when, over the cigars, three of the younger men — Simon the doctor, Brown the priest, and the detri mental O’Brien, the exile in a foreign uniform — all melted away to mix with the ladies or smoke in the conservatory, then the English diplomatist grew very undiplomatic indeed. 

He was stung every sixty seconds with the thought that the scamp O’Brien might be signalling to Margaret somehow; he did not attempt to imagine how. 

He was left over the coffee with Brayne, the hoary Yankee who believed in all religions, and Valentin, the grizzled French man who believed in none. 

They could argue with each other, but neither could appeal to him. 

After a time this “progressive” logomachy had reached a crisis of tedium; Lord Galloway got up also and 41G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 42 sought the drawing room. 

He lost his way in long passages for some six or eight minutes: till he heard the high pitched, didactic voice of the doctor, and then the dull voice of the priest, followed by general laughter. 

They also, he thought with a curse, were probably arguing about “science and religion.” But the instant he opened the salon door he saw only one thing — he saw what was not there. 

He saw that Commandant O’Brien was absent, and that Lady Margaret was absent too. 

Rising impatiently from the drawing room, as he had from the dining room, he stamped along the passage once more. 

His notion of protecting his daughter from the Irish Algerian n’er do weel had become something central and even mad in his mind. 

As he went towards the back of the house, where was Valentin’s study, he was surprised to meet his daughter, who swept past with a white, scornful face, which was a second enigma. 

If she had been with O’Brien, where was O’Brien? If she had not been with O’Brien, where had she been? With a sort of senile and passionate suspicion he groped his way to the dark back parts of the man sion, and eventually found a servants’ entrance that opened on to the garden. 

The moon with her scimi tar had now ripped up and rolled away all the storm wrack. 

The argent light lit up all four corners of the garden. 

A tall figure in blue was stridingTHE SECRET GARDEN across the lawn towards the study door; a glint of moonlit silver on his facings picked him out as Commandant O’Brien. 

He vanished through the French windows into the house, leaving Lord Galloway in an indescriba ble temper, at once virulent and vague. 

The blue and silver garden, like a scene in a theatre, seemed to taunt him with all that tyrannic tenderness against which his worldly authority was at war. 

The length and grace of the Irishman’s stride enraged him as if he were a rival instead of a father; the moonlight maddened him. 

He was trapped as if by magic into a garden of troubadours, a Watteau1 fairyland; and, willing to shake off such amorous imbecilities by speech, he stepped briskly after his enemy. 

As he did so he tripped over some tree or stone in the grass; looked down at it first with irrita tion and then a second time with curiosity. 

The next instant the moon and the tall poplars looked at an unusual sight — an elderly English diplomatist run ning hard and crying or bellowing as he ran. 

His hoarse shouts brought a pale face to the study door, the beaming glasses and worried brow of Dr. 

Simon, who heard the nobleman’s first clear 1 Watteau — Антуан Ватто (1684–1721), французский живописец и рисовальщик; бытовые и театральные сце ны; воссоздает мир тончайших душевных состояний 43G.

CHESTERTON 44 words. 

Lord Galloway was crying: “A corpse in the grass — a blood stained corpse.” O’Brien at last had gone utterly out of his mind. 

“We must tell Valentin at once,” said the doctor, when the other had brokenly described all that he had dared to examine. 

“It is fortunate that he is here”; and even as he spoke the great detective entered the study, attracted by the cry. 

It was al most amusing to note his typical transformation; he had come with the common concern of a host and a gentleman, fearing that some guest or servant was ill. 

When he was told the gory fact, he turned with all his gravity instantly bright and businesslike; for this, however abrupt and awful, was his business. 

“Strange, gentlemen,” he said as they hurried out into the garden, “that I should have hunted myster ies all over the earth, and now one comes and settles in my own back yard. 

But where is the place?” They crossed the lawn less easily, as a slight mist had be gun to rise from the river; but under the guidance of the shaken Galloway they found the body sunken in deep grass — the body of a very tall and broad shouldered man. 

He lay face downwards, so they could only see that his big shoulders were clad in black cloth, and that his big head was bald, except for a wisp or two of brown hair that clung to his skull like wet seaweed. 

A scarlet serpent of blood crawled from under his fallen face.THE SECRET GARDEN “At least,” said Simon, with a deep and singular intonation, “he is none of our party.” “Examine him, doctor,” cried Valentin rather sharply. 

“He may not be dead.” The doctor bent down. 

“He is not quite cold, but I am afraid he is dead enough,” he answered. 

“Just help me to lift him up.” They lifted him carefully an inch from the ground, and all doubts as to his being really dead were settled at once and frightfully. 

The head fell away. 

It had been entirely sundered from the body; whoever had cut his throat had managed to sever the neck as well. 

Even Valentin was slightly shocked. 

“He must have been as strong as a gorilla,” he mut tered. 

Not without a shiver, though he was used to ana tomical abortions, Dr. 

Simon lifted the head. 

It was slightly slashed about the neck and jaw, but the face was substantially unhurt. 

It was a ponderous, yellow face, at once sunken and swollen, with a hawk like nose and heavy lids — a face of a wicked Roman em peror, with, perhaps, a distant touch of a Chinese emperor. 

All present seemed to look at it with the coldest eye of ignorance. 

Nothing else could be noted about the man except that, as they had lifted his body, they had seen underneath it the white gleam of a shirt front defaced with a red gleam of blood. 

As Dr. 

Simon said, the man had never been of their 45G.

CHESTERTON 46 party. 

But he might very well have been trying to join it, for he had come dressed for such an occa sion. 

Valentin went down on his hands and knees and examined with his closest professional attention the grass and ground for some twenty yards round the body, in which he was assisted less skillfully by the doctor, and quite vaguely by the English lord. 

Noth ing rewarded their grovellings except a few twigs, snapped or chopped into very small lengths, which Valentin lifted for an instant’s examination and then tossed away. 

“Twigs,” he said gravely; “twigs, and a total stranger with his head cut off; that is all there is on this lawn.” There was an almost creepy stillness, and then the unnerved Galloway called out sharply: “Who’s that? Who’s that over there by the gar den wall?” A small figure with a foolishly large head drew waveringly near them in the moonlit haze; looked for an instant like a goblin, but turned out to be the harmless little priest whom they had left in the drawing room. 

“I say,” he said meekly, “there are no gates to this garden, do you know.” Valentin’s black brows had come together some what crossly, as they did on principle at the sight ofTHE SECRET GARDEN the cassock. 

But he was far too just a man to deny the relevance of the remark. 

“You are right,” he said. 

“Before we find out how he came to be killed, we may have to find out how he came to be here. 

Now listen to me, gentlemen. 

If it can be done without prejudice to my position and duty, we shall all agree that certain distinguished names might well be kept out of this. 

There are ladies, gentlemen, and there is a foreign ambassador. 

If we must mark it down as a crime, then it must be followed up1 as a crime. 

But till then I can use my own discretion. 

I am the head of the police; I am so public that I can afford to be private. 

Please Heaven, I will clear everyone of my own guests before I call in my men to look for any body else. 

Gentlemen, upon your honour, you will none of you leave the house till tomorrow at noon; there are bedrooms for all. 

Simon, I think you know where to find my man, Ivan, in the front hall; he is a confidential man2. 

Tell him to leave another servant on guard and come to me at once. 

Lord Galloway, you are certainly the best person to tell the ladies what has happened, and prevent a panic. 

They also must stay.

CHESTERTON 48 When this spirit of the captain spoke in Valen tin he was obeyed like a bugle. 

Dr. 

Simon went through to the armoury and routed out Ivan, the public detective’s private detective. 

Galloway went to the drawing room and told the terrible news tactfully enough, so that by the time the company assembled there the ladies were already startled and already soothed. 

Meanwhile the good priest and the good atheist stood at the head and foot of the dead man motionless in the moonlight, like symbolic statues of their two philosophies of death. 

Ivan, the confidential man with the scar and the moustaches, came out of the house like a cannon ball, and came racing across the lawn to Valentin like a dog to his master. 

His livid face was quite live ly with the glow of this domestic detective story, and it was with almost unpleasant eagerness that he asked his master’s permission to examine the re mains. 

“Yes; look, if you like, Ivan,” said Valentin, “but don’t be long. 

We must go in and thrash this out in the house.” Ivan lifted the head, and then almost let it drop. 

“Why,” he gasped, “it’s — no, it isn’t; it can’t be. 

Do you know this man, sir?” “No,” said Valentin indifferently; “we had better go inside.”THE SECRET GARDEN Between them they carried the corpse to a sofa in the study, and then all made their way to the draw ing room. 

The detective sat down at a desk quietly, and even without hesitation; but his eye was the iron eye of a judge at assize. 

He made a few rapid notes upon paper in front of him, and then said shortly: “Is eve rybody here?” “Not Mr. 

Brayne,” said the Duchess of Mont St. 

Michel, looking round. 

“No,” said Lord Galloway in a hoarse, harsh voice. 

“And not Mr. 

Neil O’Brien, I fancy. 

I saw that gentleman walking in the garden when the corpse was still warm.” “Ivan,” said the detective, “go and fetch Com mandant O’Brien and Mr. 

Brayne. 

Mr. 

Brayne, I know, is finishing a cigar in the dining room; Com mandant O’Brien, I think, is walking up and down the conservatory. 

I am not sure.” The faithful attendant flashed from the room, and before anyone could stir or speak Valentin went on with the same soldierly swiftness of exposition. 

“Everyone here knows that a dead man has been found in the garden, his head cut clean from his body. 

Dr. 

Simon, you have examined it. 

Do you think that to cut a man’s throat like that would need great force? Or, perhaps, only a very sharp knife?” 49G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON “I should say that it could not be done with a knife at all,” said the pale doctor. 

“Have you any thought,” resumed Valentin, “of a tool with which it could be done?” “Speaking within modern probabilities, I really haven’t,” said the doctor, arching his painful brows. 

“It’s not easy to hack a neck through even clumsily, and this was a very clean cut. 

It could be done with a battle axe or an old headsman’s axe, or an old two handed sword.” “But, good heavens!” cried the Duchess, almost in hysterics, “there aren’t any two handed swords and battle axes round here.” Valentin was still busy with the paper in front of him. 

“Tell me,” he said, still writing rapidly, “could it have been done with a long French cavalry sabre?” A low knocking came at the door, which, for some unreasonable reason, curdled everyone’s blood like the knocking in Macbeth1. 

Amid that fro zen silence Dr. 

Simon managed to say: “A sabre — yes, I suppose it could.” “Thank you,” said Valentin. 

“Come in, Ivan.” The confidential Ivan opened the door and ush ered in Commandant Neil O’Brien, whom he had found at last pacing the garden again.

“What do you want with me?” he cried. 

“Please sit down,” said Valentin in pleasant, level tones. 

“Why, you aren’t wearing your sword. 

Where is it?” “I left it on the library table,” said O’Brien, his brogue deepening in his disturbed mood. 

“It was a nuisance, it was getting — ” “Ivan,” said Valentin, “please go and get the Commandant’s sword from the library.” Then, as the servant vanished, “Lord Galloway says he saw you leaving the garden just before he found the corpse. 

What were you doing in the garden?” The Commandant flung himself recklessly into a chair. 

“Oh,” he cried in pure Irish, “admirin’ the moon. 

Communing with Nature, me boy.” A heavy silence sank and endured, and at the end of it came again that trivial and terrible knocking. 

Ivan reappeared, carrying an empty steel scabbard. 

“This is all I can find,” he said. 

“Put it on the table,” said Valentin, without look ing up. 

There was an inhuman silence in the room, like that sea of inhuman silence round the dock of the condemned murderer.

Lord Galloway’s swollen hatred was satisfied and even sobered.

He was asking me to marry him. 

I re fused; I said in my family circumstances I could give him nothing but my respect.

For I offer it him now. 

I will swear anywhere that he never did a thing like this.” Lord Galloway had edged up to his daughter, and was intimidating her in what he imagined to be an undertone. 

“Hold your tongue, Maggie,” he said in a thunderous whisper. 

“Why should you shield the fellow? Where’s his sword? Where’s his confounded cavalry — ” He stopped because of the singular stare with which his daughter was regarding him, a look that was indeed a lurid magnet for the whole group. 

“You old fool!” she said in a low voice without pretence of piety, “what do you suppose you are try ing to prove? I tell you this man was innocent while with me. 

But if he wasn’t innocent, he was still with me. 

If he murdered a man in the garden, who was it who must have seen — who must at least have known? Do you hate Neil so much as to put your own daughter — ”THE SECRET GARDEN Lady Galloway screamed. 

Everyone else sat tin gling at the touch of those satanic tragedies that have been between lovers before now. 

They saw the proud, white face of the Scotch aristocrat and her lover, the Irish adventurer, like old portraits in a dark house. 

The long silence was full of formless historical memories of murdered husbands and poi sonous paramours. 

In the centre of this morbid silence an innocent voice said: “Was it a very long cigar?” The change of thought was so sharp that they had to look round to see who had spoken. 

“I mean,” said little Father Brown, from the cor ner of the room, “I mean that cigar Mr. 

Brayne is finishing. 

It seems nearly as long as a walking stick.” Despite the irrelevance there was assent as well as irritation in Valentin’s face as he lifted his head. 

“Quite right,” he remarked sharply. 

“Ivan, go and see about Mr. 

Brayne again, and bring him here at once.” The instant the factotum had closed the door, Valentin addressed the girl with an entirely new ear nestness. 

“Lady Margaret,” he said, “we all feel, I am sure, both gratitude and admiration for your act in rising above your lower dignity and explaining the Com mandant’s conduct. 

But there is a hiatus still. 

Lord 53G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 54 Galloway, I understand, met you passing from the study to the drawing room, and it was only some minutes afterwards that he found the garden and the Commandant still walking there.” “You have to remember,” replied Margaret, with a faint irony in her voice, “that I had just refused him, so we should scarcely have come back arm in arm. 

He is a gentleman, anyhow; and he loitered be hind — and so got charged with murder.” “In those few moments,” said Valentin gravely, “he might really — ” The knock came again, and Ivan put in his scarred face. 

“Beg pardon, sir,” he said, “but Mr. 

Brayne has left the house.” “Left!” cried Valentin, and rose for the first time to his feet. 

“Gone. 

Scooted. 

Evaporated,” replied Ivan in hu morous French. 

“His hat and coat are gone, too, and I’ll tell you something to cap it all. 

I ran outside the house to find any traces of him, and I found one, and a big trace, too.” “What do you mean?” asked Valentin. 

“I’ll show you,” said his servant, and reappeared with a flashing naked cavalry sabre, streaked with blood about the point and edge. 

Everyone in the room eyed it as if it were a thunderbolt; but the ex perienced Ivan went on quite quietly:THE SECRET GARDEN “I found this,” he said, “flung among the bushes fifty yards up the road to Paris. 

In other words, I found it just where your respectable Mr. 

Brayne threw it when he ran away.” There was again a silence, but of a new sort. 

Val entin took the sabre, examined it, reflected with un affected concentration of thought, and then turned a respectful face to O’Brien. 

“Commandant,” he said, “we trust you will always produce this weapon if it is wanted for police examination. 

Meanwhile,” he added, slapping the steel back in the ringing scabbard, “let me return you your sword.” At the military symbolism of the action the audi ence could hardly refrain from applause. 

For Neil O’Brien, indeed, that gesture was the turning point of existence. 

By the time he was wan dering in the mysterious garden again in the colours of the morning the tragic futility of his ordinary mien had fallen from him; he was a man with many reasons for happiness. 

Lord Galloway was a gentle man, and had offered him an apology. 

Lady Marga ret was something better than a lady, a woman at least, and had perhaps given him something better than an apology, as they drifted among the old flower beds before breakfast. 

The whole company was more lighthearted and humane, for though the rid dle of the death remained, the load of suspicion was lifted off them all, and sent flying off to Paris with 55G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON the strange millionaire — a man they hardly knew. 

The devil was cast out of the house — he had cast himself out. 

Still, the riddle remained; and when O’Brien threw himself on a garden seat beside Dr. 

Simon, that keenly scientific person at once resumed it. 

He did not get much talk out of O’Brien, whose thoughts were on pleasanter things. 

“I can’t say it interests me much,” said the Irish man frankly, “especially as it seems pretty plain now. 

Apparently Brayne hated this stranger for some rea son; lured him into the garden, and killed him with my sword. 

Then he fled to the city, tossing the sword away as he went. 

By the way, Ivan tells me the dead man had a Yankee dollar in his pocket. 

So he was a countryman of Brayne’s, and that seems to clinch it. 

I don’t see any difficulties about the business.” “There are five colossal difficulties,” said the doctor quietly; “like high walls within walls. 

Don’t mistake me1. 

I don’t doubt that Brayne did it; his flight, I fancy, proves that. 

But as to how he did it. 

First difficulty: Why should a man kill another man with a great hulking sabre, when he can almost kill him with a pocket knife and put it back in his pock et? Second difficulty: Why was there no noise or outcry? Does a man commonly see another come up 1 56 Don’t mistake me — (разг.) поймите меня правильноTHE SECRET GARDEN waving a scimitar and offer no remarks? Third diffi culty: A servant watched the front door all the evening; and a rat cannot get into Valentin’s garden anywhere. 

How did the dead man get into the gar den? Fourth difficulty: Given the same conditions, how did Brayne get out of the garden?” “And the fifth,” said Neil, with eyes fixed on the English priest who was coming slowly up the path. 

“Is a trifle, I suppose,” said the doctor, “but I think an odd one. 

When I first saw how the head had been slashed, I supposed the assassin had struck more than once. 

But on examination I found many cuts across the truncated section; in other words, they were struck after the head was off. 

Did Brayne hate his foe so fiendishly that he stood sabring his body in the moonlight?” “Horrible!” said O’Brien, and shuddered. 

The little priest, Brown, had arrived while they were talking, and had waited, with characteristic shyness, till they had finished. 

Then he said awk wardly: “I say, I’m sorry to interrupt. 

But I was sent to tell you the news!” “News?” repeated Simon, and stared at him rath er painfully through his glasses. 

“Yes, I’m sorry,” said Father Brown mildly. 

“There’s been another murder, you know.” Both men on the seat sprang up, leaving it rocking. 

57G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON “And, what’s stranger still,” continued the priest, with his dull eye on the rhododendrons, “it’s the same disgusting sort; it’s another beheading. 

They found the second head actually bleeding into the river, a few yards along Brayne’s road to Paris; so they suppose that he — ” “Great Heaven!” cried O’Brien. 

“Is Brayne a monomaniac?” “There are American vendettas,” said the priest impassively. 

Then he added: “They want you to come to the library and see it.” Commandant O’Brien followed the others to wards the inquest, feeling decidedly sick. 

As a sol dier, he loathed all this secretive carnage; where were these extravagant amputations going to stop? First one head was hacked off, and then another; in this case (he told himself bitterly) it was not true that two heads were better than one. 

As he crossed the study he almost staggered at a shocking coinci dence. 

Upon Valentin’s table lay the coloured pic ture of yet a third bleeding head; and it was the head of Valentin himself. 

A second glance showed him it was only a Nationalist paper, called The Guillotine, which every week showed one of its political oppo nents with rolling eyes and writhing features just af ter execution; for Valentin was an anti clerical of some note1. 

But O’Brien was an Irishman, with a 1 58 of some note — (разг.) причем довольно известныйTHE SECRET GARDEN kind of chastity even in his sins; and his gorge rose against that great brutality of the intellect which be longs only to France. 

He felt Paris as a whole, from the grotesques on the Gothic churches to the gross caricatures in the newspapers. 

He remembered the gigantic jests of the Revolution. 

He saw the whole city as one ugly energy, from the sanguinary sketch lying on Valentin’s table up to where, above a mountain and forest of gargoyles, the great devil grins on Notre Dame. 

The library was long, low, and dark; what light entered it shot from under low blinds and had still some of the ruddy tinge of morning. 

Valentin and his servant Ivan were waiting for them at the upper end of a long, slightly sloping desk, on which lay the mortal remains, looking enormous in the twi light. 

The big black figure and yellow face of the man found in the garden confronted them essential ly unchanged. 

The second head, which had been fished from among the river reeds that morning, lay streaming and dripping beside it; Valentin’s men were still seeking to recover the rest of this second corpse, which was supposed to be afloat. 

Father Brown, who did not seem to share O’Brien’s sensi bilities in the least, went up to the second head and examined it with his blinking care. 

It was little more than a mop of wet white hair, fringed with silver fire in the red and level morning light; the face, which 59G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 60 seemed of an ugly, empurpled and perhaps criminal type, had been much battered against trees or stones as it tossed in the water. 

“Good morning, Commandant O’Brien,” said Valentin, with quiet cordiality. 

“You have heard of Brayne’s last experiment in butchery, I suppose?” Father Brown was still bending over the head with white hair, and he said, without looking up: “I suppose it is quite certain that Brayne cut off this head, too.” “Well, it seems common sense,” said Valentin, with his hands in his pockets. 

“Killed in the same way as the other. 

Found within a few yards of the other. 

And sliced by the same weapon which we know he carried away.” “Yes, yes; I know,” replied Father Brown submis sively. 

“Yet, you know, I doubt whether Brayne could have cut off this head.” “Why not?” inquired Dr. 

Simon, with a rational stare. 

“Well, doctor,” said the priest, looking up blink ing, “can a man cut off his own head? I don’t know.” O’Brien felt an insane universe crashing about his ears; but the doctor sprang forward with impet uous practicality and pushed back the wet white hair. 

“Oh, there’s no doubt it’s Brayne,” said the priest quietly. 

“He had exactly that chip in the left ear.”THE SECRET GARDEN The detective, who had been regarding the priest with steady and glittering eyes, opened his clenched mouth and said sharply: “You seem to know a lot about him, Father Brown.” “I do,” said the little man simply. 

“I’ve been about with him for some weeks. 

He was thinking of join ing our church.” The star of the fanatic sprang into Valentin’s eyes; he strode towards the priest with clenched hands. 

“And, perhaps,” he cried, with a blasting sneer, “perhaps he was also thinking of leaving all his money to your church.” “Perhaps he was,” said Brown stolidly; “it is pos sible.” “In that case,” cried Valentin, with a dreadful smile, “you may indeed know a great deal about him. 

About his life and about his — ” Commandant O’Brien laid a hand on Valentin’s arm. 

“Drop that slanderous rubbish, Valentin,” he said, “or there may be more swords yet.” But Valentin (under the steady, humble gaze of the priest) had already recovered himself. 

“Well,” he said shortly, “people’s private opinions can wait. 

You gentlemen are still bound by your promise to stay; you must enforce it on yourselves — and on each other. 

Ivan here will tell you anything more you want to know; I must get to business and write to the authorities. 

We can’t keep this quiet any longer. 

61G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON I shall be writing in my study if there is any more news.” “Is there any more news, Ivan?” asked Dr. 

Simon, as the chief of police strode out of the room. 

“Only one more thing, I think, sir,” said Ivan, wrinkling up his grey old face, “but that’s impor tant, too, in its way. 

There’s that old buffer you found on the lawn,” and he pointed without pre tence of reverence at the big black body with the yellow head. 

“We’ve found out who he is, anyhow.” “Indeed!” cried the astonished doctor, “and who is he?” “His name was Arnold Becker,” said the under de tective, “though he went by many aliases. 

He was a wandering sort of scamp, and is known to have been in America; so that was where Brayne got his knife into him. 

We didn’t have much to do with him ourselves, for he worked mostly in Germany. 

We’ve communicat ed, of course, with the German police. 

But, oddly enough, there was a twin brother of his, named Louis Becker, whom we had a great deal to do with. 

In fact, we found it necessary to guillotine him only yesterday. 

Well, it’s a rum thing, gentlemen, but when I saw that fellow flat on the lawn I had the greatest jump of my life. 

If I hadn’t seen Louis Becker guillotined1 with my 1 guillotined — (разг.) гильотирование во Франции отменили лишь в 1978г. 

62THE SECRET GARDEN own eyes, I’d have sworn it was Louis Becker lying there in the grass. 

Then, of course, I remembered his twin brother in Germany, and following up the clue — ” The explanatory Ivan stopped, for the excellent reason that nobody was listening to him. 

The Com mandant and the doctor were both staring at Father Brown, who had sprung stiffly to his feet, and was holding his temples tight like a man in sudden and violent pain. 

“Stop, stop, stop!” he cried; “stop talking a minute, for I see half. 

Will God give me strength? Will my brain make the one jump and see all? Heav en help me! I used to be fairly good at thinking. 

I could paraphrase any page in Aquinas1 once. 

Will my head split — or will it see? I see half — I only see half.” He buried his head in his hands, and stood in a sort of rigid torture of thought or prayer, while the other three could only go on staring at this last prodigy of their wild twelve hours. 

When Father Brown’s hands fell they showed a face quite fresh and serious, like a child’s. 

He heaved a huge sigh, and said: “Let us get this said and done 1 Aquinas — Фома Аквинский (1225–1274), итальян ский схоласт, философ, главный теолог Римской католи ческой церкви 63G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 64 with as quickly as possible. 

Look here, this will be the quickest way to convince you all of the truth.” He turned to the doctor. 

“Dr. 

Simon,” he said, “you have a strong head piece, and I heard you this morning asking the five hardest questions about this business. 

Well, if you will ask them again, I will answer them.” Simon’s pince nez dropped from his nose in his doubt and wonder, but he answered at once. 

“Well, the first question, you know, is why a man should kill another with a clumsy sabre at all when a man can kill with a bodkin?” “A man cannot be behead with a bodkin,” said Brown calmly, “and for this murder beheading was absolutely necessary.” “Why?” asked O’Brien, with interest. 

“And the next question?” asked Father Brown. 

“Well, why didn’t the man cry out or anything?” asked the doctor. 

“Sabres in gardens are certainly unusual.” “Twigs,” said the priest gloomily, and turned to the window which looked on the scene of death. 

“No one saw the point of the twigs. 

Why should they lie on that lawn (look at it) so far from any tree? They were not snapped off; they were chopped off. 

The murderer occupied his enemy with some tricks with the sabre, showing how he could cut a branch in mid air, or what not. 

Then, while his enemyTHE SECRET GARDEN bent down to see the result, a silent slash, and the head fell.” “Well,” said the doctor slowly, “that seems plau sible enough. 

But my next two questions will stump anyone.” The priest still stood looking critically out of the window and waited. 

“You know how all the garden was sealed up like an air tight chamber,” went on the doctor. 

“Well, how did the strange man get into the garden?” Without turning round, the little priest answered: “There never was any strange man in the garden.” There was a silence, and then a sudden cackle of almost childish laughter relieved the strain. 

The ab surdity of Brown’s remark moved Ivan to open taunts. 

“Oh!” he cried, “then we didn’t lug a great fat corpse on to a sofa last night? He hadn’t got into the garden, I suppose?” “Got into the garden?” repeated Brown reflec tively. 

“No, not entirely.” “Hang it all,” cried Simon, “a man gets into a garden, or he doesn’t.” “Not necessarily,” said the priest, with a faint smile. 

“What is the nest question, doctor?” “I fancy you’re ill,” exclaimed Dr. 

Simon sharply, “but I’ll ask the next question if you like. 

How did Brayne get out of the garden?” 65G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 66 “He didn’t get out of the garden,” said the priest, still looking out of the window. 

“Didn’t get out of the garden?” exploded Simon. 

“Not completely,” said Father Brown. 

Simon shook his fists in a frenzy of French logic. 

“A man gets out of a garden, or he doesn’t,” he cried. 

“Not always,” said Father Brown. 

Dr. 

Simon sprang to his feet impatiently. 

“I have no time to spare on such senseless talk,” he cried angrily. 

“If you can’t understand a man being on one side of a wall or the other, I won’t trouble you further.” “Doctor,” said the cleric very gently, “we have al ways got on very pleasantly together. 

If only for the sake of old friendship, stop and tell me your fifth question.” The impatient Simon sank into a chair by the door and said briefly: “The head and shoulders were cut about in a queer way. 

It seemed to be done after death.” “Yes,” said the motionless priest, “it was done so as to make you assume exactly the one simple falsehood that you did assume. 

It was done to make you take for granted that the head belonged to the body.” The borderland of the brain, where all the mon sters are made, moved horribly in the Gaelic O’Brien. 

He felt the chaotic presence of all the horse men and fish women that man’s unnatural fancy has begotten. 

A voice older than his first faTHE SECRET GARDEN thers seemed saying in his ear: “Keep out of the monstrous garden where grows the tree with double fruit. 

Avoid the evil garden where died the man with two heads.” Yet, while these shameful symbolic shapes passed across the ancient mirror of his Irish soul, his Frenchified intellect was quite alert, and was watching the odd priest as closely and incredu lously as all the rest. 

Father Brown had turned round at last, and stood against the window, with his face in dense shadow; but even in that shadow they could see it was pale as ashes. 

Nevertheless, he spoke quite sen sibly, as if there were no Gaelic souls on earth. 

“Gentlemen,” he said, “you did not find the strange body of Becker in the garden. 

You did not find any strange body in the garden. 

In face of Dr. 

Simon’s rationalism, I still affirm that Becker was only partly present. 

Look here!” (pointing to the black bulk of the mysterious corpse) “you never saw that man in your lives. 

Did you ever see this man?” He rapidly rolled away the bald, yellow head of the unknown, and put in its place the white maned head beside it. 

And there, complete, unified, unmis takable, lay Julius K. 

Brayne. 

“The murderer,” went on Brown quietly, “hacked off his enemy’s head and flung the sword far over the wall. 

But he was too clever to fling the sword only. 

He flung the head over the wall also. 

Then he 67G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 68 had only to clap on another head to the corpse, and (as he insisted on a private inquest) you all imag ined a totally new man.” “Clap on another head!” said O’Brien staring. 

“What other head? Heads don’t grow on garden bushes, do they?” “No,” said Father Brown huskily, and looking at his boots; “there is only one place where they grow. 

They grow in the basket of the guillotine, beside which the chief of police, Aristide Valentin, was standing not an hour before the murder. 

Oh, my friends, hear me a minute more before you tear me in pieces. 

Valentin is an honest man, if being mad for an arguable cause is honesty. 

But did you never see in that cold, grey eyes of his that he is mad! He would do anything, anything, to break what he calls the superstition of the Cross. 

He has fought for it and starved for it, and now he has murdered for it. 

Brayne’s crazy millions had hitherto been scattered among so many sects that they did little to alter the balance of things. 

But Valentin heard a whisper that Brayne, like so many scatter brained sceptics, was drifting to us; and that was quite a different thing. 

Brayne would pour supplies into the impoverished and pugnacious Church of France; he would sup port six Nationalist newspapers like The Guillotine. 

The battle was already balanced on a point, and the fanatic took flame at the risk. 

He resolved to destroy1 Cato — Като Марк Порций (95–46 гг. 

до н. 

э.), рим ский государственный деятель, философ стоик THE SECRET GARDEN the millionaire, and he did it as one would expect the greatest of detectives to commit his only crime. 

He abstracted the severed head of Becker on some criminological excuse, and took it home in his offi cial box. 

He had that last argument with Brayne, that Lord Galloway did not hear the end of; that failing, he led him out into the sealed garden, talked about swordsmanship, used twigs and a sabre for il lustration, and — ” Ivan of the Scar sprang up. 

“You lunatic,” he yelled, “you’ll go to my master now, if I take you by — ” “Why, I was going there,” said Brown heavily; “I must ask him to confess, and all that.” Driving the unhappy Brown before them like a hostage or sacrifice, they rushed together into the sudden stillness of Valentin’s study. 

The great detective sat at his desk apparently too occupied to hear their turbulent entrance. 

They paused a moment, and then something in the look of that upright and elegant back made the doctor run forward suddenly. 

A touch and a glance showed him that there was a small box of pills at Valentin’s elbow, and that Valentin was dead in his chair; and on the blind face of the suicide was more than the pride of Cato1.The Queer Feet I F you meet a member of that select club, “The Twelve True Fishermen,” entering the Vernon Hotel for the annual club dinner, you will observe, as he takes off his overcoat, that his evening coat is green and not black. 

If (supposing that you have the star defying audacity to address such a being) you ask him why, he will probably answer that he does it to avoid being mistaken for a waiter. 

You will then retire crushed. 

But you will leave behind you a mys tery as yet unsolved and a tale worth telling. 

If (to pursue the same vein of improbable conjec ture) you were to meet a mild, hard working little priest, named Father Brown, and were to ask him what he thought was the most singular luck of his life, he would probably reply that upon the whole his best stroke was at the Vernon Hotel, where he had averted a crime and, perhaps, saved a soul, merely by listening to a few footsteps in a passage. 

He is perhaps a little proud of this wild and wonder ful guess of his, and it is possible that he might refer 70THE QUEER FEET to it. 

But since it is immeasurably unlikely that you will ever rise high enough in the social world to find “The Twelve True Fishermen,” or that you will ever sink low enough among slums and criminals to find Father Brown, I fear you will never hear the story at all unless you hear it from me. 

The Vernon Hotel at which The Twelve True Fishermen held their annual dinners was an institu tion such as can only exist in an oligarchical society which has almost gone mad on good manners. 

It was that topsyturvy product — an “exclusive” com mercial enterprise. 

That is, it was a thing which paid not by attracting people, but actually by turning people away. 

In the heart of a plutocracy tradesmen become cunning enough to be more fastidious than their customers. 

They positively create difficulties so that their wealthy and weary clients may spend money and diplomacy in overcoming them. 

If there were a fashionable hotel in London which no man could enter who was under six foot, society would meekly make up parties of six foot men to dine in it. 

If there were an expensive restaurant which by a mere caprice of its proprietor was only open on Thursday afternoon, it would be crowded on Thurs day afternoon. 

The Vernon Hotel stood, as if by ac cident, in the corner of a square in Belgravia. 

It was a small hotel; and a very inconvenient one. 

But its very inconveniences were considered as walls pro 71G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 72 tecting a particular class. 

One inconvenience, in particular, was held to be of vital importance: the fact that practically only twenty four people could dine in the place at once. 

The only big dinner table was the celebrated terrace table, which stood open to the air on a sort of veranda overlooking one of the most exquisite old gardens in London. 

Thus it happened that even the twenty four seats at this table could only be enjoyed in warm weather; and this making the enjoyment yet more difficult made it yet more desired. 

The existing owner of the hotel was a Jew named Lever; and he made nearly a mil lion out of it, by making it difficult to get into. 

Of course he combined with this limitation in the scope of his enterprise the most careful polish in its per formance. 

The wines and cooking were really as good as any in Europe, and the demeanour of the attendants exactly mirrored the fixed mood of the English upper class. 

The proprietor knew all his waiters like the fingers on his hand; there were only fifteen of them all told. 

It was much easier to be come a Member of Parliament than to become a waiter in that hotel. 

Each waiter was trained in terri ble silence and smoothness, as if he were a gentle man’s servant. 

And, indeed, there was generally at least one waiter to every gentleman who dined. 

The club of The Twelve True Fishermen would not have consented to dine anywhere but in such aTHE QUEER FEET place, for it insisted on a luxurious privacy; and would have been quite upset by the mere thought that any other club was even dining in the same building. 

On the occasion of their annual dinner the Fishermen were in the habit of exposing all their treasures, as if they were in a private house, espe cially the celebrated set of fish knives and forks which were, as it were, the insignia of the society, each being exquisitely wrought in silver in the form of a fish, and each loaded at the hilt with one large pearl. 

These were always laid out for the fish course, and the fish course was always the most magnificent in that magnificent repast. 

The society had a vast number of ceremonies and observances, but it had no history and no object; that was where it was so very aristocratic. 

You did not have to be anything in order to be one of the Twelve Fishers; unless you were already a certain sort of person, you never even heard of them. 

It had been in existence twelve years. 

Its president was Mr. 

Audley. 

Its vice president was the Duke of Chester. 

If I have in any degree conveyed the atmosphere of this appalling hotel, the reader may feel a natural wonder as to how I came to know anything about it, and may even speculate as to how so ordinary a per son as my friend Father Brown came to find himself in that golden galley. 

As far as that is concerned, my story is simple, or even vulgar. 

There is in the world 73G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 74 a very aged rioter and demagogue who breaks into the most refined retreats with the dreadful informa tion that all men are brothers, and wherever this leveller went on his pale horse it was Father Brown’s trade to follow. 

One of the waiters, an Italian, had been struck down with a paralytic stroke that after noon; and his Jewish employer, marvelling mildly at such superstitions, had consented to send for the nearest Popish priest. 

With what the waiter con fessed to Father Brown we are not concerned, for the excellent reason that that cleric kept it to him self; but apparently it involved him in writing out a note or statement for the conveying of some mes sage or the righting of some wrong. 

Father Brown, therefore, with a meek impudence which he would have shown equally in Buckingham Palace, asked to be provided with a room and writing materials. 

Mr. 

Lever was torn in two. 

He was a kind man, and had also that bad imitation of kindness, the dislike of any difficulty or scene. 

At the same time the pres ence of one unusual stranger in his hotel that evening was like a speck of dirt on something just cleaned. 

There was never any borderland or ante room in the Vernon Hotel, no people waiting in the hall, no customers coming in on chance. 

There were fifteen waiters. 

There were twelve guests. 

It would be as startling to find a new guest in the hotel that night as to find a new brother taking breakfast orTHE QUEER FEET tea in one’s own family. 

Moreover, the priest’s ap pearance was second rate and his clothes muddy; a mere glimpse of him afar off might precipitate a cri sis in the club. 

Mr. 

Lever at last hit on a plan to cover, since he might not obliterate, the disgrace. 

When you enter (as you never will) the Vernon Hotel, you pass down a short passage decorated with a few din gy but important pictures, and come to the main vestibule and lounge which opens on your right into passages leading to the public rooms, and on your left to a similar passage pointing to the kitchens and offices of the hotel. 

Immediately on your left hand is the corner of a glass office, which abuts upon the lounge — a house within a house, so to speak, like the old hotel bar which probably once occupied its place. 

In this office sat the representative of the propri etor (nobody in this place ever appeared in person if he could help it), and just beyond the office, on the way to the servants’ quarters, was the gentlemen’s cloak room, the last boundary of the gentlemen’s domain. 

But between the office and the cloak room was a small private room without other outlet, sometimes used by the proprietor for delicate and important matters, such as lending a duke a thou sand pounds or declining to lend him sixpence. 

It is a mark of the magnificent tolerance of Mr. 

Lever that he permitted this holy place to be for about half 75G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON an hour profaned by a mere priest, scribbling away on a piece of paper. 

The story which Father Brown was writing down was very likely a much better story than this one, only it will never be known. 

I can merely state that it was very nearly as long, and that the last two or three paragraphs of it were the least exciting and absorbing. 

For it was by the time that he had reached these that the priest began a little to allow his thoughts to wander and his animal senses, which were common ly keen, to awaken. 

The time of darkness and dinner was drawing on; his own forgotten little room was without a light, and perhaps the gathering gloom, as occasionally happens, sharpened the sense of sound. 

As Father Brown wrote the last and least es sential part of his document, he caught himself writing to the rhythm of a recurrent noise outside, just as one sometimes thinks to the tune of a railway train. 

When he became conscious of the thing he found what it was: only the ordinary patter of feet passing the door, which in an hotel was no very un likely matter1. 

Nevertheless, he stared at the dark ened ceiling, and listened to the sound. 

After he had listened for a few seconds dreamily, he got to his feet and listened intently, with his head a little on 1 was no very unlikely matter — было обычным де лом; не было чем то из ряда вон 76THE QUEER FEET one side. 

Then he sat down again and buried his brow in his hands, now not merely listening, but lis tening and thinking also. 

The footsteps outside at any given moment were such as one might hear in any hotel; and yet, taken as a whole, there was something very strange about them. 

There were no other footsteps. 

It was always a very silent house, for the few familiar guests went at once to their own apartments, and the well trained waiters were told to be almost invisible until they were wanted. 

One could not conceive any place where there was less reason to apprehend anything irregular. 

But these footsteps were so odd that one could not decide to call them regular or irregular. 

Father Brown followed them with his finger on the edge of the table, like a man trying to learn a tune on the piano. 

First, there came a long rush of rapid little steps, such as a light man might make in winning a walk ing race. 

At a certain point they stopped and changed to a sort of slow, swinging stamp, number ing not a quarter of the steps, but occupying about the same time. 

The moment the last echoing stamp had died away would come again the run or ripple of light, hurrying feet, and then again the thud of the heavier walking. 

It was certainly the same pair of boots, partly because (as has been said) there were no other boots about, and partly because they 77G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 78 had a small but unmistakable creak in them. 

Father Brown had the kind of head that cannot help asking questions; and on this apparently trivial question his head almost split. 

He had seen men run in order to jump. 

He had seen men run in order to slide. 

But why on earth should a man run in order to walk? Or, again, why should he walk in order to run? Yet no other description would cover the antics of this in visible pair of legs. 

The man was either walking very fast down one half of the corridor in order to walk very slow down the other half; or he was walking very slow at one end to have the rapture of walking fast at the other. 

Neither suggestion seemed to make much sense. 

His brain was growing darker and darker, like his room. 

Yet, as he began to think steadily, the very black ness of his cell seemed to make his thoughts more vivid; he began to see as in a kind of vision the fan tastic feet capering along the corridor in unnatural or symbolic attitudes. 

Was it a heathen religious dance? Or some entirely new kind of scientific exer cise? Father Brown began to ask himself with more exactness what the steps suggested. 

Taking the slow step first: it certainly was not the step of the proprie tor. 

Men of his type walk with a rapid waddle, or they sit still. 

It could not be any servant or messen ger waiting for directions. 

It did not sound like it. 

The poorer orders (in an oligarchy) sometimesTHE QUEER FEET lurch about when they are slightly drunk, but gen erally, and especially in such gorgeous scenes, they stand or sit in constrained attitudes. 

No, that heavy yet springy step, with a kind of careless emphasis, not specially noisy, yet not caring what noise it made, belonged to only one of the animals of this earth. 

It was a gentleman of western Europe, and probably one who had never worked for his living1. 

Just as he came to this solid certainty, the step changed to the quicker one, and ran past the door as feverishly as a rat. 

The listener remarked that though this step was much swifter it was also much more noiseless, almost as if the man were walking on tiptoe. 

Yet it was not associated in his mind with secrecy, but with something else — something that he could not remember. 

He was maddened by one of those half memories that make a man feel half wit ted. 

Surely he had heard that strange, swift walking somewhere. 

Suddenly he sprang to his feet with a new idea in his head, and walked to the door. 

His room had no direct outlet on the passage, but let on one side into the glass office, and on the other into the cloak room beyond. 

He tried the door into the office, and found it locked. 

Then he looked at the window, now a square pane full of purple cloud cleft 1 who had never worked for his living — (разг.) кото рому никогда не приходилось зарабатывать себе на жизнь 79G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 80 by livid sunset, and for an instant he smelt evil as a dog smells rats. 

The rational part of him (whether the wiser or not) regained its supremacy. 

He remembered that the proprietor had told him that he should lock the door, and would come later to release him. 

He told himself that twenty things he had not thought of might explain the eccentric sounds outside; he re minded himself that there was just enough light left to finish his own proper work. 

Bringing his paper to the window so as to catch the last stormy evening light, he resolutely plunged once more into the al most completed record. 

He had written for about twenty minutes, bending closer and closer to his pa per in the lessening light; then suddenly he sat up right. 

He had heard the strange feet once more. 

This time they had a third oddity. 

Previously the unknown man had walked, with levity indeed and lightning quickness, but he had walked. 

This time he ran. 

One could hear the swift, soft, bounding steps coming along the corridor, like the pads of a fleeing and leaping panther. 

Whoever was coming was a very strong, active man, in still yet tearing excitement. 

Yet, when the sound had swept up to the office like a sort of whispering whirlwind, it suddenly changed again to the old slow, swaggering stamp. 

Father Brown flung down his paper, and, know ing the office door to be locked, went at once intoTHE QUEER FEET the cloak room on the other side. 

The attendant of this place was temporarily absent, probably because the only guests were at dinner and his office was a sinecure. 

After groping through a grey forest of overcoats, he found that the dim cloak room opened on the lighted corridor in the form of a sort of coun ter or half door, like most of the counters across which we have all handed umbrellas and received tickets. 

There was a light immediately above the semicircular arch of this opening. 

It threw little illu mination on Father Brown himself, who seemed a mere dark outline against the dim sunset window behind him. 

But it threw an almost theatrical light on the man who stood outside the cloak room in the corridor. 

He was an elegant man in very plain evening dress; tall, but with an air of not taking up much room; one felt that he could have slid along like a shadow where many smaller men would have been obvious and obstructive. 

His face, now flung back in the lamplight, was swarthy and vivacious, the face of a foreigner. 

His figure was good, his manners good humoured and confident; a critic could only say that his black coat was a shade below his figure and manners, and even bulged and bagged in an odd way. 

The moment he caught sight of Brown’s black silhouette against the sunset, he tossed down a scrap of paper with a number and called out with 81G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 82 amiable authority: “I want my hat and coat, please; I find I have to go away at once.” Father Brown took the paper without a word, and obediently went to look for the coat; it was not the first menial work he had done in his life. 

He brought it and laid it on the counter; meanwhile, the strange gentleman who had been feeling in his waistcoat pocket, said laughing: “I haven’t got any silver; you can keep this.” And he threw down half a sovereign, and caught up his coat. 

Father Brown’s figure remained quite dark and still; but in that instant he had lost his head. 

His head was always most valuable when he had lost it. 

In such moments he put two and two together and made four million. 

Often the Catholic Church (which is wedded to common sense) did not approve of it. 

Often he did not approve of it himself. 

But it was real inspira tion — important at rare crises — when whosoever shall lose his head the same shall save it. 

“I think, sir,” he said civilly, “that you have some silver in your pocket.” The tall gentleman stared. 

“Hang it,” he cried, “if I choose to give you gold, why should you complain?” “Because silver is sometimes more valuable than gold,” said the priest mildly, “that is, in large quanti ties.” The stranger looked at him curiously. 

Then he looked still more curiously up the passage towards1 THE QUEER FEET the main entrance. 

Then he looked back at Brown again, and then he looked very carefully at the win dow beyond Brown’s head, still coloured with the after glow of the storm. 

Then he seemed to make up his mind. 

He put one hand on the counter, vaulted over as easily as an acrobat and towered above the priest, putting one tremendous hand upon his collar. 

“Stand still,” he said, in a hacking whisper. 

“I don’t want to threaten you, but — ” “I do want to threaten you,” said Father Brown, in a voice like a rolling drum, “I want to threaten you with the worm that dieth not, and the fire that is not quenched.” “You’re a rum sort of cloak room clerk,” said the other. 

“I am a priest, Monsieur Flambeau,” said Brown, “and I am ready to hear your confession.” The other stood gasping for a few moments, and then staggered back into a chair. 

The first two courses of the dinner of The Twelve True Fishermen had proceeded with placid success. 

I do not possess a copy of the menu; and if I did it would not convey anything to anybody. 

It was writ ten in a sort of super French employed by cooks, but quite unintelligible to Frenchmen. 

There was a tradition in the club that the hors d’oeuvres1 should horsd’oeuvres — (фр.) закуски 83G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 84 be various and manifold to the point of madness. 

They were taken seriously because they were avow edly useless extras, like the whole dinner and the whole club. 

There was also a tradition that the soup course should be light and unpretending — a sort of simple and austere vigil for the feast of fish that was to come. 

The talk was that strange, slight talk which governs the British Empire, which governs it in se cret, and yet would scarcely enlighten an ordinary Englishman even if he could overhear it. 

Cabinet ministers on both sides were alluded to by their Christian names with a sort of bored benignity. 

The Radical Chancellor of the Exchequer, whom the whole Tory party was supposed to be cursing for his extortions, was praised for his minor poetry, or his saddle in the hunting field. 

The Tory leader, whom all Liberals were supposed to hate as a tyrant, was discussed and, on the whole, praised — as a Liberal. 

It seemed somehow that politicians were very im portant. 

And yet, anything seemed important about them except their politics. 

Mr. 

Audley, the chair man, was an amiable, elderly man who still wore Gladstone collars; he was a kind of symbol of all that phantasmal and yet fixed society. 

He had never done anything — not even anything wrong. 

He was not fast; he was not even particularly rich. 

He was simply in the thing; and there was an end of it. 

No party could ignore him, and if he had wished to beTHE QUEER FEET in the Cabinet he certainly would have been put there. 

The Duke of Chester, the vice president, was a young and rising politician. 

That is to say, he was a pleasant youth, with flat, fair hair and a freckled face, with moderate intelligence and enormous es tates. 

In public his appearances were always suc cessful and his principle was simple enough. 

When he thought of a joke he made it, and was called bril liant. 

When he could not think of a joke he said that this was no time for trifling, and was called able. 

In private, in a club of his own class, he was simply quite pleasantly frank and silly, like a schoolboy. 

Mr. 

Audley, never having been in politics, treated them a little more seriously. 

Sometimes he even em barrassed the company by phrases suggesting that there was some difference between a Liberal and a Conservative. 

He himself was a Conservative, even in private life. 

He had a roll of grey hair over the back of his collar, like certain old fashioned states men, and seen from behind he looked like the man the empire wants. 

Seen from the front he looked like a mild, self indulgent bachelor, with rooms in the Albany — which he was. 

As has been remarked, there were twenty four seats at the terrace table, and only twelve members of the club. 

Thus they could occupy the terrace in the most luxurious style of all, being ranged along the inner side of the table, with no one opposite, 85G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 86 commanding an uninterrupted view of the garden, the colours of which were still vivid, though evening was closing in somewhat luridly for the time of year. 

The chairman sat in the centre of the line, and the vice president at the right hand end of it. 

When the twelve guests first trooped into their seats it was the custom (for some unknown reason) for all the fif teen waiters to stand lining the wall like troops pre senting arms to the king, while the fat proprietor stood and bowed to the club with radiant surprise, as if he had never heard of them before. 

But before the first chink of knife and fork this army of retain ers had vanished, only the one or two required to collect and distribute the plates darting about in deathly silence. 

Mr. 

Lever, the proprietor, of course had disappeared in convulsions of courtesy long be fore. 

It would be exaggerative, indeed irreverent, to say that he ever positively appeared again. 

But when the important course, the fish course, was being brought on, there was — how shall I put it? — a viv id shadow, a projection of his personality, which told that he was hovering near. 

The sacred fish course consisted (to the eyes of the vulgar) in a sort of monstrous pudding, about the size and shape of a wedding cake, in which some considerable number of interesting fishes had finally lost the shapes which God had given to them. 

The Twelve True Fishermen took up their celebrated fish knives andTHE QUEER FEET fish forks, and approached it as gravely as if every inch of the pudding cost as much as the silver fork it was eaten with. 

So it did, for all I know. 

This course was dealt with in eager and devouring silence; and it was only when his plate was nearly empty that the young duke made the ritual remark: “They can’t do this anywhere but here.” “Nowhere,” said Mr. 

Audley, in a deep bass voice, turning to the speaker and nodding his venerable head a number of times. 

“Nowhere, assuredly, except here. 

It was represented to me that at the CafXe Anglais — ” Here he was interrupted and even agitated for a moment by the removal of his plate, but he recap tured the valuable thread of his thoughts. 

“It was represented to me that the same could be done at the CafXe Anglais. 

Nothing like it, sir,” he said, shak ing his head ruthlessly, like a hanging judge1. 

“Nothing like it.” “Overrated place,” said a certain Colonel Pound, speaking (by the look of him) for the first time for some months. 

“Oh, I don’t know,” said the Duke of Chester, who was an optimist, “it’s jolly good for some things. 

You can’t beat it at — ” 1 like a hanging judge — как судья, выносящий приго вор о повешении 87G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 88 A waiter came swiftly along the room, and then stopped dead. 

His stoppage was as silent as his tread; but all those vague and kindly gentlemen were so used to the utter smoothness of the unseen machin ery which surrounded and supported their lives, that a waiter doing anything unexpected was a start and a jar. 

They felt as you and I would feel if the inanimate world disobeyed — if a chair ran away from us. 

The waiter stood staring a few seconds, while there deepened on every face at table a strange shame which is wholly the product of our time. 

It is the combination of modern humanitarianism with the horrible modern abyss between the souls of the rich and poor. 

A genuine historic aristocrat would have thrown things at the waiter, beginning with empty bottles, and very probably ending with money. 

A genuine democrat would have asked him, with comrade like clearness of speech, what the devil he was doing. 

But these modern plutocrats could not bear a poor man near to them, either as a slave or as a friend. 

That something had gone wrong with the servants was merely a dull, hot embarrassment. 

They did not want to be brutal, and they dreaded the need to be benevolent. 

They wanted the thing, whatever it was, to be over. 

It was over. 

The waiter, after standing for some seconds rigid, like a cata leptic, turned round and ran madly out of the room.THE QUEER FEET When he reappeared in the room, or rather in the doorway, it was in company with another waiter, with whom he whispered and gesticulated with southern fierceness1. 

Then the first waiter went away, leaving the second waiter, and reappeared with a third waiter. 

By the time a fourth waiter had joined this hurried synod, Mr. 

Audley felt it neces sary to break the silence in the interests of tact. 

He used a very loud cough, instead of a presidential hammer, and said: “Splendid work young Mooch er’s doing in Burmah. 

Now, no other nation in the world could have — ” A fifth waiter had sped towards him like an ar row, and was whispering in his ear: “So sorry. 

Im portant! Might the proprietor speak to you?” The chairman turned in disorder, and with a dazed stare saw Mr. 

Lever coming towards them with his lumbering quickness. 

The gait of the good proprietor was indeed his usual gait, but his face was by no means usual. 

Generally it was a genial copper brown; now it was a sickly yellow. 

“You will pardon me, Mr. 

Audley,” he said, with asthmatic breathlessness. 

“I have great apprehen sions. 

Your fish plates, they are cleared away with the knife and fork on them!” 1 with southern fierceness — с экспрессивностью, свой ственной южанам 89G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 90 “Well, I hope so,” said the chairman, with some warmth. 

“You see him?” panted the excited hotel keeper; “you see the waiter who took them away? You know him?” “Know the waiter?” answered Mr. 

Audley indig nantly. 

“Certainly not!” Mr. 

Lever opened his hands with a gesture of ag ony. 

“I never send him,” he said. 

“I know not when or why he come. 

I send my waiter to take away the plates, and he find them already away.” Mr. 

Audley still looked rather too bewildered to be really the man the empire wants; none of the company could say anything except the man of wood — Colonel Pound — who seemed galvanised into an unnatural life. 

He rose rigidly from his chair, leaving all the rest sitting, screwed his eyeglass into his eye, and spoke in a raucous undertone as if he had half forgotten how to speak. 

“Do you mean,” he said, “that somebody has stolen our silver fish service?” The proprietor repeated the open handed ges ture with even greater helplessness and in a flash all the men at the table were on their feet. 

“Are all your waiters here?” demanded the colo nel, in his low, harsh accent. 

“Yes, they’re all here. 

I noticed it myself,” cried the young duke, pushing his boyish face into the in most ring. 

“Always count ’em as I come in; they look so queer standing up against the wall.”THE QUEER FEET “But surely one cannot exactly remember,” be gan Mr. 

Audley, with heavy hesitation. 

“I remember exactly, I tell you,” cried the duke excitedly. 

“There never have been more than fifteen waiters at this place, and there were no more than fifteen tonight, I’ll swear; no more and no less.” The proprietor turned upon him, quaking in a kind of palsy of surprise. 

“You say — you say,” he stammered, “that you see all my fifteen waiters?” “As usual,” assented the duke. 

“What is the mat ter with that!” “Nothing,” said Lever, with a deepening accent, “only you did not. 

For one of zem is dead upstairs.” There was a shocking stillness for an instant in that room. 

It may be (so supernatural is the word death) that each of those idle men looked for a second at his soul, and saw it as a small dried pea. 

One of them — the duke, I think — even said with the idiotic kind ness of wealth: “Is there anything we can do?” “He has had a priest,” said the Jew, not un touched. 

Then, as to the clang of doom, they awoke to their own position. 

For a few weird seconds they had really felt as if the fifteenth waiter might be the ghost of the dead man upstairs. 

They had been dumb under that oppression, for ghosts were to them an embarrassment, like beggars. 

But the re membrance of the silver broke the spell of the mi 91G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 92 raculous; broke it abruptly and with a brutal reac tion. 

The colonel flung over his chair and strode to the door. 

“If there was a fifteenth man here, friends,” he said, “that fifteenth fellow was a thief. 

Down at once to the front and back doors and secure everything; then we’ll talk. 

The twenty four pearls of the club are worth recovering.” Mr. 

Audley seemed at first to hesitate about whether it was gentlemanly to be in such a hurry about anything; but, seeing the duke dash down the stairs with youthful energy, he followed with a more mature motion. 

At the same instant a sixth waiter ran into the room, and declared that he had found the pile of fish plates on a sideboard, with no trace of the silver. 

The crowd of diners and attendants that tumbled helter skelter down the passages divided into two groups. 

Most of the Fishermen followed the proprie tor to the front room to demand news of any exit. 

Colonel Pound, with the chairman, the vice presi dent, and one or two others darted down the corri dor leading to the servants’ quarters, as the more likely line of escape. 

As they did so they passed the dim alcove or cavern of the cloak room, and saw a short, black coated figure, presumably an attend ant, standing a little way back in the shadow of it. 

“Hallo, there!” called out the duke. 

“Have you seen anyone pass?”THE QUEER FEET The short figure did not answer the question di rectly, but merely said: “Perhaps I have got what you are looking for, gentlemen.” They paused, wavering and wondering, while he quietly went to the back of the cloak room, and came back with both hands full of shining silver, which he laid out on the counter as calmly as a salesman. 

It took the form of a dozen quaintly shaped forks and knives. 

“You — you — ” began the colonel, quite thrown off his balance at last. 

Then he peered into the dim little room and saw two things: first, that the short, black clad man was dressed like a clergyman; and, second, that the window of the room behind him was burst, as if someone had passed violently through. 

“Valuable things to deposit in a cloak room, aren’t they?” remarked the clergyman, with cheerful composure. 

“Did — did you steal those things?” stammered Mr. 

Audley, with staring eyes. 

“If I did,” said the cleric pleasantly, “at least I am bringing them back again.” “But you didn’t,” said Colonel Pound, still star ing at the broken window. 

“To make a clean breast of it1, I didn’t,” said the other, with some humour. 

And he seated himself 1 To make a clean breast of it — (разг.) честно говоря; по правде сказать 93G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 94 quite gravely on a stool. 

“But you know who did,” said the colonel. 

“I don’t know his real name,” said the priest placid ly, “but I know something of his fighting weight, and a great deal about his spiritual difficulties. 

I formed the physical estimate when he was trying to throttle me, and the moral estimate when he repented.” “Oh, I say — repented!” cried young Chester, with a sort of crow of laughter. 

Father Brown got to his feet, putting his hands behind him. 

“Odd, isn’t it,” he said, “that a thief and a vagabond should repent, when so many who are rich and secure remain hard and frivolous, and without fruit for God or man? But there, if you will excuse me, you trespass a little upon my province. 

If you doubt the penitence as a practical fact, there are your knives and forks. 

You are The Twelve True Fishers, and there are all your silver fish. 

But He has made me a fisher of men.” “Did you catch this man?” asked the colonel, frowning. 

Father Brown looked him full in his frowning face. 

“Yes,” he said, “I caught him, with an unseen hook and an invisible line which is long enough to let him wander to the ends of the world, and still to bring him back with a twitch upon the thread.” There was a long silence. 

All the other men present drifted away to carry the recovered silver toTHE QUEER FEET their comrades, or to consult the proprietor about the queer condition of affairs. 

But the grim faced colonel still sat sideways on the counter, swinging his long, lank legs and biting his dark moustache. 

At last he said quietly to the priest: “He must have been a clever fellow, but I think I know a cleverer.” “He was a clever fellow,” answered the other, “but I am not quite sure of what other you mean.” “I mean you,” said the colonel, with a short laugh. 

“I don’t want to get the fellow jailed; make yourself easy about that. 

But I’d give a good many silver forks to know exactly how you fell into this affair, and how you got the stuff out of him. 

I reck on you’re the most up to date devil of the present company.” Father Brown seemed rather to like the saturnine candour of the soldier. 

“Well,” he said, smiling, “I mustn’t tell you anything of the man’s identity, or his own story, of course; but there’s no particular reason why I shouldn’t tell you of the mere outside facts which I found out for myself.” He hopped over the barrier with unexpected ac tivity, and sat beside Colonel Pound, kicking his short legs like a little boy on a gate. 

He began to tell the story as easily as if he were telling it to an old friend by a Christmas fire. 

“You see, colonel,” he said, “I was shut up in that small room there doing some writing, when I heard 95G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON a pair of feet in this passage doing a dance that was as queer as the dance of death. 

First came quick, funny little steps, like a man walking on tiptoe for a wager; then came slow, careless, creaking steps, as of a big man walking about with a cigar. 

But they were both made by the same feet, I swear, and they came in rotation; first the run and then the walk, and then the run again. 

I wondered at first idly and then wildly why a man should act these two parts at once. 

One walk I knew; it was just like yours, colonel. 

It was the walk of a well fed gentleman waiting for something, who strolls about rather because he is physically alert than because he is mentally impa tient. 

I knew that I knew the other walk, too, but I could not remember what it was. 

What wild crea ture had I met on my travels that tore along on tip toe in that extraordinary style? Then I heard a clink of plates somewhere; and the answer stood up as plain as St. 

Peter’s1. 

It was the walk of a waiter — that walk with the body slanted forward, the eyes looking down, the ball of the toe spurning away the ground, the coat tails and napkin flying. 

Then I thought for a minute and a half more. 

And I believe I saw the manner of the crime, as clearly as if I were going to commit it.” 1 96 St. 

Peter’s — собор святого Петра1 THE QUEER FEET Colonel Pound looked at him keenly, but the speaker’s mild grey eyes were fixed upon the ceiling with almost empty wistfulness. 

“A crime,” he said slowly, “is like any other work of art. 

Don’t look surprised; crimes are by no means the only works of art that come from an infernal workshop. 

But every work of art, divine or diabolic, has one indispensable mark — I mean, that the cen tre of it is simple, however much the fulfilment may be complicated. 

Thus, in Hamlet1, let us say, the gro tesqueness of the grave digger, the flowers of the mad girl, the fantastic finery of Osric, the pallor of the ghost and the grin of the skull are all oddities in a sort of tangled wreath round one plain tragic fig ure of a man in black. 

Well, this also,” he said, get ting slowly down from his seat with a smile, “this also is the plain tragedy of a man in black. 

Yes,” he went on, seeing the colonel look up in some wonder, “the whole of this tale turns on a black coat. 

In this, as in Hamlet, there are the rococo excrescences — yourselves, let us say. 

There is the dead waiter, who was there when he could not be there. 

There is the invisible hand that swept your table clear of silver and melted into air. 

But every clever crime is found ed ultimately on some one quite simple fact — some fact that is not itself mysterious. 

The mystification Hamlet — трагедия В. 

Шекспира «Гамлет» 97G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON 98 comes in covering it up, in leading men’s thoughts away from it. 

This large and subtle and (in the ordi nary course) most profitable crime, was built on the plain fact that a gentleman’s evening dress is the same as a waiter’s. 

All the rest was acting, and thun dering good acting, too.” “Still,” said the colonel, getting up and frowning at his boots, “I am not sure that I understand.” “Colonel,” said Father Brown, “I tell you that this archangel of impudence who stole your forks walked up and down this passage twenty times in the blaze of all the lamps, in the glare of all the eyes. 

He did not go and hide in dim corners where suspi cion might have searched for him. 

He kept con stantly on the move in the lighted corridors, and everywhere that he went he seemed to be there by right. 

Don’t ask me what he was like; you have seen him yourself six or seven times tonight. 

You were waiting with all the other grand people in the recep tion room at the end of the passage there, with the terrace just beyond. 

Whenever he came among you gentlemen, he came in the lightning style of a wait er, with bent head, flapping napkin and flying feet. 

He shot out on to the terrace, did something to the table cloth, and shot back again towards the office and the waiters’ quarters. 

By the time he had come under the eye of the office clerk and the waiters he had become another man in every inch of his body, inTHE QUEER FEET every instinctive gesture. 

He strolled among the serv ants with the absent minded insolence which they have all seen in their patrons. 

It was no new thing to them that a swell from the dinner party should pace all parts of the house like an animal at the Zoo; they know that nothing marks the Smart Set more than a habit of walking where one chooses. 

When he was magnificently weary of walking down that particular passage he would wheel round and pace back past the office; in the shadow of the arch just beyond he was altered as by a blast of magic, and went hurry ing forward again among the Twelve Fishermen, an obsequious attendant. 

Why should the gentlemen look at a chance waiter? Why should the waiters suspect a first rate walking gentleman? Once or twice he played the coolest tricks. 

In the proprie tor’s private quarters he called out breezily for a sy phon of soda water, saying he was thirsty. 

He said genially that he would carry it himself, and he did; he carried it quickly and correctly through the thick of you, a waiter with an obvious errand. 

Of course, it could not have been kept up long, but it only had to be kept up till the end of the fish course. 

“His worst moment was when the waiters stood in a row; but even then he contrived to lean against the wall just round the corner in such a way that for that important instant the waiters thought him a gentleman, while the gentlemen thought him a 99G.

The rest went like winking. 

If any waiter caught him away from the table, that waiter caught a languid aristocrat. 

He had only to time himself two minutes before the fish was cleared, become a swift servant, and clear it himself. 

He put the plates down on a sideboard, stuffed the silver in his breast pocket, giving it a bulgy look, and ran like a hare (I heard him coming) till he came to the cloak room. 

There he had only to be a plutocrat again — a pluto crat called away suddenly on business. 

He had only to give his ticket to the cloak room attendant, and go out again elegantly as he had come in. 

Only — only I happened to be the cloak room attendant.” “What did you do to him?” cried the colonel, with unusual intensity. 

“What did he tell you?” “I beg your pardon,” said the priest immovably, “that is where the story ends.” “And the interesting story begins,” muttered Pound. 

“I think I understand his professional trick. 

But I don’t seem to have got hold of yours.” “I must be going,” said Father Brown. 

They walked together along the passage to the entrance hall, where they saw the fresh, freckled face of the Duke of Chester, who was bounding buoyantly along towards them. 

“Come along, Pound,” he cried breathlessly. 

“I’ve been looking for you everywhere. 

The dinner’s go ing again in spanking style, and old Audley has got 100THE QUEER FEET to make a speech in honour of the forks being saved. 

We want to start some new ceremony, don’t you know, to commemorate the occasion. 

I say, you really got the goods back, what do you suggest?” “Why,” said the colonel, eyeing him with a cer tain sardonic approval, “I should suggest that henceforward we wear green coats, instead of black. 

One never knows what mistakes may arise when one looks so like a waiter.” “Oh, hang it all!” said the young man, “a gentle man never looks like a waiter.” “Nor a waiter like a gentleman, I suppose,” said Colonel Pound, with the same lowering laughter on his face. 

“Reverend sir, your friend must have been very smart to act the gentleman.” Father Brown buttoned up his commonplace overcoat to the neck, for the night was stormy, and took his commonplace umbrella from the stand. 

“Yes,” he said; “it must be very hard work to be a gentleman; but, do you know, I have sometimes thought that it may be almost as laborious to be a waiter.” And saying “Good evening,” he pushed open the heavy doors of that palace of pleasures. 

The golden gates closed behind him, and he went at a brisk walk through the damp, dark streets in search of a penny omnibus.The Invisible Man I N the cool blue twilight of two steep streets in Camden Town, the shop at the corner, a con fectioner’s, glowed like the butt of a cigar. 

One should rather say, perhaps, like the butt of a fire work, for the light was of many colours and some complexity, broken up by many mirrors and dancing on many gilt and gaily coloured cakes and sweet meats. 

Against this one fiery glass were glued the noses of many gutter snipes, for the chocolates were all wrapped in those red and gold and green metallic colours which are almost better than choco late itself; and the huge white wedding cake in the window was somehow at once remote and satisfy ing, just as if the whole North Pole were good to eat. 

Such rainbow provocations could naturally collect the youth of the neighbourhood up to the ages of ten or twelve. 

But this corner was also attractive to youth at a later stage; and a young man, not less than twenty four, was staring into the same shop window. 

To him, also, the shop was of fiery charm, 1021 THE INVISIBLE MAN but this attraction was not wholly to be explained by chocolates; which, however, he was far from despis ing. 

He was a tall, burly, red haired young man, with a resolute face but a listless manner. 

He carried un der his arm a flat, grey portfolio of black and white sketches, which he had sold with more or less suc cess to publishers ever since his uncle (who was an admiral) had disinherited him for Socialism, because of a lecture which he had delivered against that eco nomic theory. 

His name was John Turnbull Angus. 

Entering at last, he walked through the confec tioner’s shop to the back room, which was a sort of pastry cook restaurant, merely raising his hat to the young lady who was serving there. 

She was a dark, elegant, alert girl in black, with a high colour1 and very quick, dark eyes; and after the ordinary interval she followed him into the inner room to take his order. 

His order was evidently a usual one. 

“I want, please,” he said with precision, “one halfpenny bun and a small cup of black coffee.” An instant before the girl could turn away he added, “Also, I want you to marry me.” The young lady of the shop stiffened suddenly and said, “Those are jokes I don’t allow.” with a high colour — (разг.) румяный 103G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON The red haired young man lifted grey eyes of an unexpected gravity. 

“Really and truly,” he said, “it’s as serious — as serious as the halfpenny bun. 

It is expensive, like the bun; one pays for it. 

It is indigestible, like the bun. 

It hurts.” The dark young lady had never taken her dark eyes off him, but seemed to be studying him with al most tragic exactitude. 

At the end of her scrutiny she had something like the shadow of a smile, and she sat down in a chair. 

“Don’t you think,” observed Angus, absently, “that it’s rather cruel to eat these halfpenny buns? They might grow up into penny buns. 

I shall give up these brutal sports when we are married.” The dark young lady rose from her chair and walked to the window, evidently in a state of strong but not unsympathetic cogitation. 

When at last she swung round again with an air of resolution she was bewildered to observe that the young man was care fully laying out on the table various objects from the shop window. 

They included a pyramid of highly coloured sweets, several plates of sandwiches, and the two decanters containing that mysterious port and sherry which are peculiar to pastry cooks. 

In the middle of this neat arrangement he had carefully let down the enormous load of white sugared cake which had been the huge ornament of the window. 

104THE INVISIBLE MAN “What on earth are you doing?” she asked. 

“Duty, my dear Laura,” he began. 

“Oh, for the Lord’s sake, stop a minute,” she cried, “and don’t talk to me in that way. 

I mean, what is all that?” “A ceremonial meal, Miss Hope.” “And what is that?” she asked impatiently, point ing to the mountain of sugar. 

“The wedding cake, Mrs. 

Angus,” he said. 

The girl marched to that article, removed it with some clatter, and put it back in the shop window; she then returned, and, putting her elegant elbows on the table, regarded the young man not unfavour ably but with considerable exasperation. 

“You don’t give me any time to think,” she said. 

“I’m not such a fool,” he answered; “that’s my Christian humility.” She was still looking at him; but she had grown considerably graver behind the smile. 

“Mr. 

Angus,” she said steadily, “before there is a minute more of this nonsense I must tell you some thing about myself as shortly as I can.’” “Delighted,” replied Angus gravely. 

“You might tell me something about myself, too, while you are about it.” “Oh, do hold your tongue and listen,” she said. 

“It’s nothing that I’m ashamed of, and it isn’t even anything that I’m specially sorry about. 

But what 105G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON would you say if there were something that is no business of mine and yet is my nightmare?” “In that case,” said the man seriously, “I should suggest that you bring back the cake.” “Well, you must listen to the story first,” said Laura, persistently. 

“To begin with, I must tell you that my father owned the inn called the ‘Red Fish’ at Ludbury, and I used to serve people in the bar.” “I have often wondered,” he said, “why there was a kind of a Christian air about this one confection er’s shop.” “Ludbury is a sleepy, grassy little hole in the Eastern Counties, and the only kind of people who ever came to the ‘Red Fish’ were occasional com mercial travellers, and for the rest, the most awful people you can see, only you’ve never seen them. 

I mean little, loungy men, who had just enough to live on and had nothing to do but lean about in bar rooms and bet on horses, in bad clothes that were just too good for them. 

Even these wretched young rotters were not very common at our house; but there were two of them that were a lot too com mon — common in every sort of way. 

They both lived on money of their own, and were wearisomely idle and over dressed. 

But yet I was a bit sorry for them, because I half believe they slunk into our little empty bar because each of them had a slight de formity; the sort of thing that some yokels laugh at. 

106THE INVISIBLE MAN It wasn’t exactly a deformity either; it was more an oddity. 

One of them was a surprisingly small man, something like a dwarf, or at least like a jockey. 

He was not at all jockeyish to look at, though; he had a round black head and a well trimmed black beard, bright eyes like a bird’s; he jingled money in his pockets; he jangled a great gold watch chain; and he never turned up except dressed just too much like a gentleman to be one. 

He was no fool though, though a futile idler; he was curiously clever at all kinds of things that couldn’t be the slightest use; a sort of impromptu conjuring; making fifteen match es set fire to each other like a regular firework; or cutting a banana or some such thing into a dancing doll. 

His name was Isidore Smythe; and I can see him still, with his little dark face, just coming up to the counter, making a jumping kangaroo out of five cigars. 

“The other fellow was more silent and more ordi nary; but somehow he alarmed me much more than poor little Smythe. 

He was very tall and slight, and light haired; his nose had a high bridge, and he might almost have been handsome in a spectral sort of way; but he had one of the most appalling squints I have ever seen or heard of. 

When he looked straight at you, you didn’t know where you were yourself, let alone what he was looking at. 

I fancy this sort of disfigurement embittered the poor chap 107G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON a little; for while Smythe was ready to show off his monkey tricks anywhere, James Welkin (that was the squinting man’s name) never did anything ex cept soak in our bar parlour, and go for great walks by himself in the flat, grey country all round. 

All the same, I think Smythe, too, was a little sensitive about being so small, though he carried it off more smartly. 

And so it was that I was really puzzled, as well as startled, and very sorry, when they both of fered to marry me in the same week. 

“Well, I did what I’ve since thought was perhaps a silly thing. 

But, after all, these freaks were my friends in a way; and I had a horror of their thinking I refused them for the real reason, which was that they were so impossibly ugly. 

So I made up some gas of another sort, about never meaning to marry any one who hadn’t carved his way in the world. 

I said it was a point of principle with me not to live on money that was just inherited like theirs. 

Two days after I had talked in this well meaning sort of way, the whole trouble began. 

The first thing I heard was that both of them had gone off to seek their for tunes, as if they were in some silly fairy tale. 

“Well, I’ve never seen either of them from that day to this. 

But I’ve had two letters from the little man called Smythe, and really they were rather ex citing.” “Ever heard of the other man?” asked Angus. 

108THE INVISIBLE MAN “No, he never wrote,” said the girl, after an in stant’s hesitation. 

“Smythe’s first letter was simply to say that he had started out walking with Welkin to London; but Welkin was such a good walker that the little man dropped out of it, and took a rest by the roadside. 

He happened to be picked up by some travelling show, and, partly because he was nearly a dwarf, and partly because he was really a clever little wretch, he got on quite well in the show business, and was soon sent up to the Aquarium, to do some tricks that I forget. 

That was his first letter. 

His second was much more of a startler, and I only got it last week.” The man called Angus emptied his coffee cup and regarded her with mild and patient eyes. 

Her own mouth took a slight twist of laughter as she re sumed, “I suppose you’ve seen on the hoardings all about this ‘Smythe’s Silent Service’? Or you must be the only person that hasn’t. 

Oh, I don’t know much about it, it’s some clockwork invention for doing all the housework by machinery. 

You know the sort of thing: ‘Press a Button — A Butler who Never Drinks.’ ‘Turn a Handle — Ten Housemaids who Never Flirt.’ You must have seen the advertisements. 

Well, whatever these machines are, they are making pots of money; and they are making it all for that little imp whom I knew down in Ludbury. 

I can’t help feeling pleased the poor little chap has fallen on his feet; but the plain fact is, I’m in terror of his 109G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON turning up any minute and telling me he’s carved his way in the world — as he certainly has.” “And the other man?” repeated Angus with a sort of obstinate quietude. 

Laura Hope got to her feet suddenly. 

“My friend,” she said, “I think you are a witch. 

Yes, you are quite right. 

I have not seen a line of the other man’s writing; and I have no more notion than the dead of what or where he is. 

But it is of him that I am frightened. 

It is he who is all about my path. 

It is he who has half driven me mad. 

Indeed, I think he has driven me mad; for I have felt him where he could not have been, and I have heard his voice when he could not have spoken.” “Well, my dear,” said the young man, cheerfully, “if he were Satan himself, he is done for now you have told somebody. 

One goes mad all alone1, old girl. 

But when was it you fancied you felt and heard our squinting friend?” “I heard James Welkin laugh as plainly as I hear you speak,” said the girl, steadily. 

“There was no body there, for I stood just outside the shop at the corner, and could see down both streets at once. 

I had forgotten how he laughed, though his laugh was as odd as his squint. 

I had not thought of 1 One goes mad all alone — (разг.) с ума сходят в оди ночку 110THE INVISIBLE MAN him for nearly a year. 

But it’s a solemn truth that a few seconds later the first letter came from his ri val.” “Did you ever make the spectre speak or squeak, or anything?” asked Angus, with some interest. 

Laura suddenly shuddered, and then said, with an unshaken voice, “Yes. 

Just when I had finished reading the second letter from Isidore Smythe an nouncing his success. 

Just then, I heard Welkin say, ‘He shan’t have you, though.’ It was quite plain, as if he were in the room. 

It is awful, I think I must be mad.” “If you really were mad,” said the young man, “you would think you must be sane. 

But certainly there seems to me to be something a little rum about this unseen gentleman. 

Two heads are better than one — I spare you allusions to any other organs and really, if you would allow me, as a sturdy, practical man, to bring back the wedding cake out of the window — ” Even as he spoke, there was a sort of steely shriek in the street outside, and a small motor, driven at devilish speed, shot up to the door of the shop and stuck there. 

In the same flash of time a small man in a shiny top hat stood stamping in the outer room. 

Angus, who had hitherto maintained hilarious ease from motives of mental hygiene, revealed the strain of his soul by striding abruptly out of the in 111G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON ner room and confronting the new comer. 

A glance at him was quite sufficient to confirm the savage guesswork of a man in love. 

This very dapper but dwarfish figure, with the spike of black beard car ried insolently forward, the clever unrestful eyes, the neat but very nervous fingers, could be none other than the man just described to him: Isidore Smythe, who made dolls out of banana skins and match boxes; Isidore Smythe, who made millions out of undrinking butlers and unflirting house maids of metal. 

For a moment the two men, instinc tively understanding each other’s air of possession, looked at each other with that curious cold generos ity which is the soul of rivalry. 

Mr. 

Smythe, however, made no allusion to the ul timate ground of their antagonism, but said simply and explosively, “Has Miss Hope seen that thing on the window?” “On the window?” repeated the staring Angus. 

“There’s no time to explain other things,” said the small millionaire shortly. 

“There’s some tom foolery going on here that has to be investigated.” He pointed his polished walking stick at the window, recently depleted by the bridal prepara tions of Mr. 

Angus; and that gentleman was aston ished to see along the front of the glass a long strip of paper pasted, which had certainly not been on the window when he looked through it some time 112THE INVISIBLE MAN before. 

Following the energetic Smythe outside into the street, he found that some yard and a half of stamp paper had been carefully gummed along the glass outside, and on this was written in straggly characters, “If you marry Smythe, he will die.” “Laura,” said Angus, putting his big red head into the shop, “you’re not mad.” “It’s the writing of that fellow Welkin,” said Smythe gruffly. 

“I haven’t seen him for years, but he’s always bothering me. 

Five times in the last fort night he’s had threatening letters left at my flat, and I can’t even find out who leaves them, let alone if it is Welkin himself. 

The porter of the flats swears that no suspicious characters have been seen, and here he has pasted up a sort of dado on a public shop window, while the people in the shop — ” “Quite so,” said Angus modestly, “while the peo ple in the shop were having tea. 

Well, sir, I can as sure you I appreciate your common sense in dealing so directly with the matter. 

We can talk about other things afterwards. 

The fellow cannot be very far off yet, for I swear there was no paper there when I went last to the window, ten or fifteen minutes ago. 

On the other hand, he’s too far off to be chased, as we don’t even know the direction. 

If you’ll take my advice, Mr. 

Smythe, you’ll put this at once in the hands of some energetic inquiry man, private rather than public. 

I know an extremely clever fellow, who 113G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON has set up in business five minutes from here in your car. 

His name’s Flambeau, and though his youth was a bit stormy, he’s a strictly honest man now, and his brains are worth money. 

He lives in Lucknow Mansions, Hampstead.” “That is odd,” said the little man, arching his black eyebrows. 

“I live, myself, in Himalaya Man sions, round the corner. 

Perhaps you might care to come with me; I can go to my rooms and sort out these queer Welkin documents, while you run round and get your friend the detective.” “You are very good,” said Angus politely. 

“Well, the sooner we act the better.” Both men, with a queer kind of impromptu fair ness, took the same sort of formal farewell of the lady, and both jumped into the brisk little car. 

As Smythe took the handles and they turned the great corner of the street, Angus was amused to see a gi gantesque poster of “Smythe’s Silent Service,” with a picture of a huge headless iron doll, carrying a sauce pan with the legend, “A Cook Who is Never Cross.” “I use them in my own flat,” said the little black bearded man, laughing, “partly for advertisements, and partly for real convenience. 

Honestly, and all above board1, those big clockwork dolls of mine do bring your coals or claret or a timetable quicker 1 114 all above board — (разг.) открыто, прямоTHE INVISIBLE MAN than any live servants I’ve ever known, if you know which knob to press. 

But I’ll never deny, between ourselves, that such servants have their disadvan tages, too. 

“Indeed?” said Angus; “is there something they can’t do?” “Yes,” replied Smythe coolly; “they can’t tell me who left those threatening letters at my flat.” The man’s motor was small and swift like him self; in fact, like his domestic service, it was of his own invention. 

If he was an advertising quack, he was one who believed in his own wares. 

The sense of something tiny and flying was accentuated as they swept up long white curves of road in the dead but open daylight of evening. 

Soon the white curves came sharper and dizzier; they were upon ascending spirals, as they say in the modern religions. 

For, in deed, they were cresting a corner of London which is almost as precipitous as Edinburgh, if not quite so picturesque. 

Terrace rose above terrace, and the special tower of flats they sought, rose above them all to almost Egyptian height, gilt by the level sun set. 

The change, as they turned the corner and en tered the crescent known as Himalaya Mansions, was as abrupt as the opening of a window; for they found that pile of flats sitting above London as above a green sea of slate. 

Opposite to the mansions, on the other side of the gravel crescent, was a bushy 115G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON enclosure more like a steep hedge or dyke than a garden, and some way below that ran a strip of arti ficial water, a sort of canal, like the moat of that em bowered fortress. 

As the car swept round the cres cent it passed, at one corner, the stray stall of a man selling chestnuts; and right away at the other end of the curve, Angus could see a dim blue policeman walking slowly. 

These were the only human shapes in that high suburban solitude; but he had an irrational sense that they expressed the speechless poetry of London. 

He felt as if they were figures in a story. 

The little car shot up to the right house like a bullet, and shot out its owner like a bomb shell. 

He was immediately inquiring of a tall commissionaire in shining braid, and a short porter in shirt sleeves, whether anybody or anything had been seeking his apartments. 

He was assured that nobody and noth ing had passed these officials since his last inquiries; whereupon he and the slightly bewildered Angus were shot up in the lift like a rocket, till they reached the top floor. 

“Just come in for a minute,” said the breathless Smythe. 

“I want to show you those Welkin letters. 

Then you might run round the corner and fetch your friend.” He pressed a button concealed in the wall, and the door opened of itself. 

1 116 opened of itself — сама открыласьTHE INVISIBLE MAN It opened on a long, commodious ante room, of which the only arresting features, ordinarily speak ing, were the rows of tall half human mechanical figures that stood up on both sides like tailors’ dum mies. 

Like tailors’ dummies they were headless; and like tailors’ dummies they had a handsome unneces sary humpiness in the shoulders, and a pigeon breasted protuberance of chest; but barring this, they were not much more like a human figure than any automatic machine at a station that is about the human height. 

They had two great hooks like arms, for carrying trays; and they were painted pea green, or vermilion, or black for convenience of distinc tion; in every other way they were only automatic machines and nobody would have looked twice at them. 

On this occasion, at least, nobody did. 

For be tween the two rows of these domestic dummies lay something more interesting than most of the me chanics of the world. 

It was a white, tattered scrap of paper scrawled with red ink; and the agile inventor had snatched it up almost as soon as the door flew open. 

He handed it to Angus without a word. 

The red ink on it actually was not dry, and the message ran, “If you have been to see her today, I shall kill you.” There was a short silence, and then Isidore Smythe said quietly, “Would you like a little whis key? I rather feel as if I should.” 117G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON “Thank you; I should like a little Flambeau,” said Angus, gloomily. 

“This business seems to me to be getting rather grave. 

I’m going round at once to fetch him.” “Right you are,” said the other, with admirable cheerfulness. 

“Bring him round here as quick as you can.” But as Angus closed the front door behind him he saw Smythe push back a button, and one of the clockwork images glided from its place and slid along a groove in the floor carrying a tray with sy phon and decanter. 

There did seem something a tri fle weird about leaving the little man alone among those dead servants, who were coming to life as the door closed. 

Six steps down from Smythe’s landing the man in shirt sleeves was doing something with a pail. 

An gus stopped to extract a promise, fortified with a prospective bribe, that he would remain in that place until the return with the detective, and would keep count of any kind of stranger coming up those stairs. 

Dashing down to the front hall he then laid similar charges of vigilance on the commissionaire at the front door, from whom he learned the simpli fying circumstances that there was no back door. 

Not content with this, he captured the floating po liceman and induced him to stand opposite the en trance and watch it; and finally paused an instant 1181 THE INVISIBLE MAN for a pennyworth of chestnuts, and an inquiry as to the probable length of the merchant’s stay in the neighbourhood. 

The chestnut seller, turning up the collar of his coat, told him he should probably be moving short ly, as he thought it was going to snow. 

Indeed, the evening was growing grey and bitter, but Angus, with all his eloquence, proceeded to nail the chest nut man to his post. 

“Keep yourself warm on your own chestnuts,” he said earnestly. 

“Eat up your whole stock; I’ll make it worth your while.1 I’ll give you a sovereign if you’ll wait here till I come back, and then tell me whether any man, woman, or child has gone into that house where the commissionaire is standing.” He then walked away smartly, with a last look at the besieged tower. 

“I’ve made a ring round that room, anyhow,” he said. 

“They can’t all four of them be Mr. 

Welkin’s accomplices.” Lucknow Mansions were, so to speak, on a lower platform of that hill of houses, of which Himalaya Mansions might be called the peak. 

Mr. 

Flambeau’s semi official flat was on the ground floor, and pre sented in every way a marked contrast to the Ameri can machinery and cold hotel like luxury of the flat I’ll make it worth your while.

CHESTERTON of the Silent Service. 

Flambeau, who was a friend of Angus, received him in a rococo artistic den behind his office, of which the ornaments were sabres, har quebuses, Eastern curiosities, flasks of Italian wine, savage cooking pots, a plumy Persian cat, and a small dusty looking Roman Catholic priest, who looked particularly out of place. 

“This is my friend Father Brown,” said Flambeau. 

“I’ve often wanted you to meet him. 

Splendid weath er, this; a little cold for Southerners like me.” “Yes, I think it will keep clear,” said Angus, sit ting down on a violet striped Eastern ottoman. 

“No,” said the priest quietly, “it has begun to snow.” And, indeed, as he spoke, the first few flakes, foreseen by the man of chestnuts, began to drift across the darkening windowpane. 

“Well,” said Angus heavily. 

“I’m afraid I’ve come on business, and rather jumpy business at that. 

The fact is, Flambeau, within a stone’s throw1 of your house is a fellow who badly wants your help; he’s perpetually being haunted and threat ened by an invisible enemy — a scoundrel whom nobody has even seen.” As Angus proceeded to tell the whole tale of Smythe and Welkin, beginning with Laura’s story, and going on with his own, the 1 120 within a stone’s throw — (разг.) в двух словахTHE INVISIBLE MAN supernatural laugh at the corner of two empty streets, the strange distinct words spoken in an empty room, Flambeau grew more and more vivid ly concerned, and the little priest seemed to be left out of it, like a piece of furniture. 

When it came to the scribbled stamp paper pasted on the window, Flambeau rose, seeming to fill the room with his huge shoulders. 

“If you don’t mind,” he said, “I think you had better tell me the rest on the nearest road to this man’s house. 

It strikes me, somehow, that there is no time to be lost.” “Delighted,” said Angus, rising also, “though he’s safe enough for the present, for I’ve set four men to watch the only hole to his burrow.” They turned out into the street, the small priest trundling after them with the docility of a small dog. 

He merely said, in a cheerful way, like one making conversation, “How quick the snow gets thick on the ground.” As they threaded the steep side streets already powdered with silver, Angus finished his story; and by the time they reached the crescent with the towering flats, he had leisure to turn his attention to the four sentinels. 

The chestnut seller, both before and after receiving a sovereign, swore stubbornly that he had watched the door and seen no visitor enter. 

The policeman was even more emphatic. 

He 121G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON said he had had experience of crooks of all kinds, in top hats and in rags; he wasn’t so green1 as to expect suspicious characters to look suspicious; he looked out for anybody, and, so help him, there had been nobody. 

And when all three men gath ered round the gilded commissionaire, who still stood smiling astride of the porch, the verdict was more final still. 

“I’ve got a right to ask any man, duke or dust man, what he wants in these flats,” said the genial and gold laced giant, “and I’ll swear there’s been nobody to ask since this gentleman went away.” The unimportant Father Brown, who stood back, looking modestly at the pavement, here ventured to say meekly, “Has nobody been up and down stairs, then, since the snow began to fall? It began while we were all round at Flambeau’s.” “Nobody’s been in here, sir, you can take it from me,” said the official, with beaming authority. 

“Then I wonder what that is?” said the priest, and stared at the ground blankly like a fish. 

The others all looked down also; and Flambeau used a fierce exclamation and a French gesture. 

For it was unquestionably true that down the middle of 1 he wasn’t so green — (разг.) он был не так наивен (неопытен) 2 you can take it from me — (разг.) уж можете мне по верить 122THE INVISIBLE MAN the entrance guarded by the man in gold lace, actu ally between the arrogant, stretched legs of that co lossus, ran a stringy pattern of grey footprints stamped upon the white snow. 

“God!” cried Angus involuntarily, “the Invisible Man!” Without another word he turned and dashed up the stairs, with Flambeau following; but Father Brown still stood looking about him in the snow clad street as if he had lost interest in his query. 

Flambeau was plainly in a mood to break down the door with his big shoulders; but the Scotchman, with more reason, if less intuition, fumbled about on the frame of the door till he found the invisible button; and the door swung slowly open. 

It showed substantially the same serried interior; the hall had grown darker, though it was still struck here and there with the last crimson shafts of sun set, and one or two of the headless machines had been moved from their places for this or that pur pose, and stood here and there about the twilight place. 

The green and red of their coats were all darkened in the dusk; and their likeness to human shapes slightly increased by their very shapeless ness. 

But in the middle of them all, exactly where the paper with the red ink had lain, there lay some thing that looked like red ink spilt out of its bottle. 

But it was not red ink.

K. 

CHESTERTON With a French combination of reason and vio lence Flambeau simply said “Murder!” and, plung ing into the flat, had explored every corner and cup board of it in five minutes. 

But if he expected to find a corpse he found none. 

Isidore Smythe was not in the place, either dead or alive. 

After the most tear ing search the two men met each other in the outer hall, with streaming faces and staring eyes. 

“My friend,” said Flambeau, talking French in his excite ment, “not only is your murderer invisible, but he makes invisible also the murdered man.” Angus looked round at the dim room full of dummies, and in some Celtic corner of his Scotch soul a shudder started. 

One of the life size dolls stood immediately overshadowing the blood stain, summoned, perhaps, by the slain man an instant be fore he fell. 

One of the high shouldered hooks that served the thing for arms, was a little lifted, and An gus had suddenly the horrid fancy that poor Smythe’s own iron child had struck him down. 

Mat ter had rebelled, and these machines had killed their master. 

But even so, what had they done with him? “Eaten him?” said the nightmare at his ear; and he sickened for an instant at the idea of rent, human remains absorbed and crushed into all that acephal ous clockwork. 

He recovered his mental health by an emphatic effort, and said to Flambeau, “Well, there it is. 

The 124THE INVISIBLE MAN poor fellow has evaporated like a cloud and left a red streak on the floor. 

The tale does not belong to this world.” “There is only one thing to be done,” said Flam beau, “whether it belongs to this world or the other. 

I must go down and talk to my friend.” They descended, passing the man with the pail, who again asseverated that he had let no intruder pass, down to the commissionaire and the hovering chestnut man, who rigidly reasserted their own watchfulness. 

But when Angus looked round for his fourth confirmation he could not see it, and called out with some nervousness, “Where is the policeman?” “I beg your pardon,” said Father Brown; “that is my fault. 

I just sent him down the road to investi gate something — that I just thought worth investi gating.” “Well, we want him back pretty soon,” said An gus abruptly, “for the wretched man upstairs has not only been murdered, but wiped out.” “How?” asked the priest. 

“Father,” said Flambeau, after a pause, “upon my soul I believe it is more in your department than mine. 

No friend or foe has entered the house, but Smythe is gone, as if stolen by the fairies. 

If that is not supernatural, I — ” As he spoke they were all checked by an unusual sight; the big blue policeman came round the corner 125G.

CHESTERTON of the crescent, running. 

He came straight up to Brown. 

“You’re right, sir,” he panted, “they’ve just found poor Mr. 

Smythe’s body in the canal down below.” Angus put his hand wildly to his head. 

“Did he run down and drown himself?” he asked. 

“He never came down, I’ll swear,” said the con stable, “and he wasn’t drowned either, for he died of a great stab over the heart.” “And yet you saw no one enter?” said Flambeau in a grave voice. 

“Let us walk down the road a little,” said the priest. 

As they reached the other end of the crescent he observed abruptly, “Stupid of me! I forgot to ask the policeman something. 

I wonder if they found a light brown sack.” “Why a light brown sack?” asked Angus, aston ished. 

“Because if it was any other coloured sack, the case must begin over again,” said Father Brown; “but if it was a light brown sack, why, the case is fin ished.” “I am pleased to hear it,” said Angus with hearty irony. 

“It hasn’t begun, so far as I am concerned.” “You must tell us all about it,” said Flambeau with a strange heavy simplicity, like a child. 

Unconsciously they were walking with quicken ing steps down the long sweep of road on the other 126THE INVISIBLE MAN side of the high crescent, Father Brown leading briskly, though in silence. 

At last he said with an al most touching vagueness, “Well, I’m afraid you’ll think it so prosy. 

We always begin at the abstract end of things, and you can’t begin this story any where else. 

“Have you ever noticed this — that people never answer what you say? They answer what you mean — or what they think you mean. 

Suppose one lady says to another in a country house, ‘Is anybody staying with you?’ the lady doesn’t answer ‘Yes; the butler, the three footmen, the parlourmaid, and so on,’ though the parlourmaid may be in the room, or the butler behind her chair. 

She says ‘There is no body staying with us,’ meaning nobody of the sort you mean. 

But suppose a doctor inquiring into an epidemic asks, ‘Who is staying in the house?’ then the lady will remember the butler, the parlourmaid, and the rest. 

All language is used like that; you never get a question answered literally, even when you get it answered truly. 

When those four quite honest men said that no man had gone into the Mansions, they did not really mean that no man had gone into them. 

They meant no man whom they could suspect of being your man. 

A man did go into the house, and did come out of it, but they never noticed him.” “An invisible man?” inquired Angus, raising his red eyebrows. 

127G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON “A mentally invisible man,” said Father Brown. 

A minute or two after he resumed in the same unassuming voice, like a man thinking his way. 

“Of course you can’t think of such a man, until you do think of him. 

That’s where his cleverness comes in. 

But I came to think of him through two or three lit tle things in the tale Mr. 

Angus told us. 

First, there was the fact that this Welkin went for long walks. 

And then there was the vast lot of stamp paper on the window. 

And then, most of all, there were the two things the young lady said — things that couldn’t be true. 

Don’t get annoyed,” he added hastily, noting a sudden movement of the Scotch man’s head; “she thought they were true. 

A person can’t be quite alone in a street a second before she receives a letter. 

She can’t be quite alone in a street when she starts reading a letter just received. 

There must be somebody pretty near her; he must be men tally invisible.” “Why must there be somebody near her?” asked Angus. 

“Because,” said Father Brown, “barring carrier pigeons1, somebody must have brought her the let ter.” 1 barring carrierpigeons — (зд.) если не было почто вых голубей 128THE INVISIBLE MAN “Do you really mean to say,” asked Flambeau, with energy, “that Welkin carried his rival’s letters to his lady?” “Yes,” said the priest. 

“Welkin carried his rival’s letters to his lady. 

You see, he had to.” “Oh, I can’t stand much more of this,” exploded Flambeau. 

“Who is this fellow? What does he look like? What is the usual get up of a mentally invisible man?” “He is dressed rather handsomely in red, blue and gold,” replied the priest promptly with precision, “and in this striking, and even showy, costume he entered Himalaya Mansions under eight human eyes; he killed Smythe in cold blood, and came down into the street again carrying the dead body in his arms — ” “Reverend sir,” cried Angus, standing still, “are you raving mad, or am I?” “You are not mad,” said Brown, “only a little un observant. 

You have not noticed such a man as this, for example.” He took three quick strides forward, and put his hand on the shoulder of an ordinary passing post man who had bustled by them unnoticed under the shade of the trees. 

“Nobody ever notices postmen somehow,” he said thoughtfully; “yet they have passions like other men, and even carry large bags where a small corpse can be stowed quite easily.” 129G.

CHESTERTON The postman, instead of turning naturally, had ducked and tumbled against the garden fence. 

He was a lean fair bearded man of very ordinary ap pearance, but as he turned an alarmed face over his shoulder, all three men were fixed with an almost fiendish squint. 

* Flambeau went back to his sabres, purple rugs and Persian cat, having many things to attend to. 

John Turnbull Angus went back to the lady at the shop, with whom that imprudent young man con trives to be extremely comfortable. 

But Father Brown walked those snow covered hills under the stars for many hours with a murderer, and what they said to each other will never be known.The Honour of Israel Gow A stormy evening of olive and silver was clos ing in, as Father Brown, wrapped in a grey Scotch plaid, came to the end of a grey Scotch valley and beheld the strange castle of Glengyle. 

It stopped one end of the glen or hollow like a blind alley; and it looked like the end of the world. 

Rising in steep roofs and spires of seagreen slate in the manner of the old French Scotch chateaux, it reminded an Englishman of the sinister steeple hats of witches in fairy tales; and the pine woods that rocked round the green turrets looked, by comparison, as black as numberless flocks of ravens. 

This note of a dreamy, almost a sleepy devilry, was no mere fancy from the landscape. 

For there did rest on the place one of those clouds of pride and madness and mysterious sorrow which lie more heavily on the noble houses of Scotland than on any other of the children of men. 

For Scotland has a double dose of the poison called heredity; the sense of blood in the aristocrat, and the sense of doom in the Calvinist. 

131G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON The priest had snatched a day from his business at Glasgow to meet his friend Flambeau, the ama teur detective, who was at Glengyle Castle with another more formal officer investigating the life and death of the late Earl of Glengyle. 

That mysteri ous person was the last representative of a race whose valour, insanity, and violent cunning had made them terrible even among the sinister nobility of their nation in the sixteenth century. 

None were deeper in that labyrinthine ambition, in chamber within chamber of that palace of lies that was built up around Mary Queen of Scots1. 

The rhyme in the country side attested the mo tive and the result of their machinations candidly: As green sap to the summer trees. 

Is red gold to the Ogilvies. 

For many centuries there had never been a de cent lord in Glengyle Castle; and with the Victorian era one would have thought that all eccentricities were exhausted. 

The last Glengyle, however, satis fied his tribal tradition by doing the only thing that was left for him to do; he disappeared. 

I do not mean that he went abroad; by all accounts he was 1 Mary Queen of Scots — (разг.) Мария Стюарт (1542– 1587), королева Шотландии в 1542–1567 гг.; обезглавлена за планирование заговора против королевы Елизаветы I 132THE HONOUR OF ISRAEL GOW still in the castle, if he was anywhere. 

But though his name was in the church register and the big red Peerage1, nobody ever saw him under the sun. 

If anyone saw him it was a solitary man servant, something between a groom and a gardener. 

He was so deaf that the more business like assumed him to be dumb; while the more penetrating declared him to be half witted. 

A gaunt, red haired labourer, with a dogged jaw and chin, but quite blank blue eyes, he went by the name of Israel Gow, and was the one si lent servant on that deserted estate. 

But the energy with which he dug potatoes, and the regularity with which he disappeared into the kitchen gave people an impression that he was providing for the meals of a superior, and that the strange earl was still con cealed in the castle. 

If society needed any further proof that he was there, the servant persistently as serted that he was not at home. 

One morning the provost and the minister (for the Glengyles were Presbyterian) were summoned to the castle. 

There they found that the gardener, groom and cook had added to his many professions that of an undertak er, and had nailed up his noble master in a coffin. 

With how much or how little further inquiry this odd fact was passed, did not as yet very plainly ap 1 big red Peerage — большая «Книга пэров» в красном переплете 133G.

CHESTERTON pear; for the thing had never been legally investigat ed till Flambeau had gone north two or three days before. 

By then the body of Lord Glengyle (if it was the body) had lain for some time in the little churchyard on the hill. 

As Father Brown passed through the dim garden and came under the shadow of the chateau, the clouds were thick and the whole air damp and thun dery. 

Against the last stripe of the green gold sunset he saw a black human silhouette; a man in a chim ney pot hat, with a big spade over his shoulder. 

The combination was queerly suggestive of a sexton; but when Brown remembered the deaf servant who dug potatoes, he thought it natural enough. 

He knew something of the Scotch peasant; he knew the re spectability which might well feel it necessary to wear “blacks” for an official inquiry; he knew also the economy that would not lose an hour’s digging for that. 

Even the man’s start and suspicious stare as the priest went by were consonant enough with the vigilance and jealousy of such a type. 

The great door was opened by Flambeau himself, who had with him a lean man with iron grey hair and papers in his hand: Inspector Craven from Scot land Yard. 

The entrance hall was mostly stripped and empty; but the pale, sneering faces of one or 1 134 a chimneypot hat — (разг.) цилиндр (шляпа)THE HONOUR OF ISRAEL GOW two of the wicked Ogilvies looked down out of black periwigs and blackening canvas. 

Following them into an inner room, Father Brown found that the allies had been seated at a long oak table, of which their end was covered with scribbled papers, flanked with whisky and cigars. 

Through the whole of its remaining length it was occupied by detached objects arranged at intervals; objects about as inexplicable as any objects could be. 

One looked like a small heap of glittering broken glass. 

Another looked like a high heap of brown dust. 

A third appeared to be a plain stick of wood. 

“You seem to have a sort of geological museum here,” he said, as he sat down, jerking his head briefly in the direction of the brown dust and the crystalline fragments. 

“Not a geological museum,” replied Flambeau; “say a psychological museum.” “Oh, for the Lord’s sake,” cried the police detec tive laughing, “don’t let’s begin with such long words.” “Don’t you know what psychology means?” asked Flambeau with friendly surprise. 

“Psychology means being off your chump1.” “Still I hardly follow,” replied the official. 

1 being off your chump — (разг.) что вы спятили (тро нулись умом) 135G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON “Well,” said Flambeau, with decision, “I mean that we’ve only found out one thing about Lord Glengyle. 

He was a maniac.” The black silhouette of Gow with his top hat and spade passed the window, dimly outlined against the darkening sky. 

Father Brown stared passively at it and answered: “I can understand there must have been some thing odd about the man, or he wouldn’t have buried himself alive — nor been in such a hurry to bury him self dead. 

But what makes you think it was lunacy?” “Well,” said Flambeau, “you just listen to the list of things Mr. 

Craven has found in the house.” “We must get a candle,” said Craven, suddenly. 

“A storm is getting up, and it’s too dark to read.” “Have you found any candles,” asked Brown smiling, “among your oddities?” Flambeau raised a grave face, and fixed his dark eyes on his friend. 

“That is curious, too,” he said. 

“Twenty five can dles, and not a trace of a candlestick.” In the rapidly darkening room and rapidly rising wind, Brown went along the table to where a bundle of wax candles lay among the other scrappy exhib its. 

As he did so he bent accidentally over the heap of red brown dust; and a sharp sneeze cracked the silence. 

“Hullo!” he said, “snuff!” 136THE HONOUR OF ISRAEL GOW He took one of the candles, lit it carefully, came back and stuck it in the neck of the whisky bottle. 

The unrestful night air, blowing through the crazy window, waved the long flame like a banner. 

And on every side of the castle they could hear the miles and miles of black pine wood seething like a black sea around a rock. 

“I will read the inventory,” began Craven gravely, picking up one of the papers, “the inventory of what we found loose and unexplained in the castle. 

You are to understand that the place generally was dis mantled and neglected; but one or two rooms had plainly been inhabited in a simple but not squalid style by somebody; somebody who was not the serv ant Gow. 

The list is as follows: “First item. 

A very considerable hoard of pre cious stones, nearly all diamonds, and all of them loose, without any setting whatever. 

Of course, it is natural that the Ogilvies should have family jewels; but those are exactly the jewels that are almost always set in particular articles of ornament. 

The Ogilvies would seem to have kept theirs loose in their pockets, like coppers. 

Second item. 

Heaps and heaps of loose snuff, not kept in a horn, or even a pouch, but lying in heaps on the mantelpieces, on the sideboard, on the piano, anywhere. 

It looks as if the old gentleman would not take the trouble to look in a pocket or lift a lid.

“Fourth item.

The core of the tale we could imagine; it is the fringes that are mysterious. 

By no stretch of fancy can the human mind connect together snuff and diamonds and wax and loose clockwork.” “I think I see the connection,” said the priest. 

“This Glengyle was mad against the French Revolu tion. 

He was an enthusiast for the ancien regime1, and was trying to re enact literally the family life of the last Bourbons2. 

He had snuff because it was the eighteenth century luxury; wax candles, because they were the eighteenth century lighting; the me chanical bits of iron represent the locksmith hobby of Louis XVI3; the diamonds are for the Diamond Necklace of Marie Antoinette4.” Both the other men were staring at him with round eyes. 

“What a perfectly extraordinary notion!” cried Flambeau. 

“Do you really think that is the truth?” 1 ancien regime — политическая и социальная система Франции перед революцией 1789 г.

K. 

CHESTERTON “I am perfectly sure it isn’t,” answered Father Brown, “only you said that nobody could connect snuff and diamonds and clockwork and candles. 

I give you that connection off hand. 

The real truth, I am very sure, lies deeper.” He paused a moment and listened to the wailing of the wind in the turrets. 

Then he said, “The late Earl of Glengyle was a thief. 

He lived a second and darker life as a desperate housebreaker. 

He did not have any candlesticks because he only used these candles cut short in the little lantern he carried. 

The snuff he employed as the fiercest French criminals have used pepper: to fling it suddenly in dense masses in the face of a captor or pursuer. 

But the fi nal proof is in the curious coincidence of the dia monds and the small steel wheels. 

Surely that makes everything plain to you? Diamonds and small steel wheels are the only two instruments with which you can cut out a pane of glass.” The bough of a broken pine tree lashed heavily in the blast against the windowpane behind them, as if in parody of a burglar, but they did not turn round. 

Their eyes were fastened on Father Brown. 

“Diamonds and small wheels,” repeated Craven ruminating. 

“Is that all that makes you think it the true explanation?” “I don’t think it is the true explanation,” replied the priest placidly; “but you said that nobody could 1401 THE HONOUR OF ISRAEL GOW connect the four things. 

The true tale, of course, is something much more humdrum. 

Glengyle had found, or thought he had found, precious stones on his estate. 

Somebody had bamboozled him with those loose brilliants, saying they were found in the castle caverns. 

The little wheels are some diamond cutting affair. 

He had to do the thing very roughly and in a small way1, with the help of a few shep herds or rude fellows on these hills. 

Snuff is the one great luxury of such Scotch shepherds; it’s the one thing with which you can bribe them. 

They didn’t have candlesticks because they didn’t want them; they held the candles in their hands when they ex plored the caves.” “Is that all?” asked Flambeau after a long pause. 

“Have we got to the dull truth at last?” “Oh, no,” said Father Brown. 

As the wind died in the most distant pine woods with a long hoot as of mockery Father Brown, with an utterly impassive face, went on: “I only suggested that because you said one could not plausibly connect snuff with clockwork or can dles with bright stones. 

Ten false philosophies will fit the universe; ten false theories will fit Glengyle Cas tle. 

But we want the real explanation of the castle and the universe. 

But are there no other exhibits?” a small way — (разг.) потихоньку 141G.

CHESTERTON Craven laughed, and Flambeau rose smiling to his feet and strolled down the long table. 

“Items five, six, seven, etc.,” he said, “and cer tainly more varied than instructive. 

A curious col lection, not of lead pencils, but of the lead out of lead pencils. 

A senseless stick of bamboo, with the top rather splintered. 

It might be the instrument of the crime. 

Only, there isn’t any crime. 

The only other things are a few old missals and little Catholic pictures, which the Ogilvies kept, I suppose, from the Middle Ages — their family pride being stronger than their Puritanism. 

We only put them in the museum because they seem curiously cut about and defaced.” The heady tempest without drove a dreadful wrack of clouds across Glengyle and threw the long room into darkness as Father Brown picked up the little illuminated pages to examine them. 

He spoke before the drift of darkness had passed; but it was the voice of an utterly new man. 

“Mr. 

Craven,” said he, talking like a man ten years younger, “you have got a legal warrant, haven’t you, to go up and examine that grave? The sooner we do it the better, and get to the bottom of this horrible affair. 

If I were you I should start now.” “Now,” repeated the astonished detective, “and why now?” “Because this is serious,” answered Brown; “this is not spilt snuff or loose pebbles, that might be 142THE HONOUR OF ISRAEL GOW there for a hundred reasons. 

There is only one rea son I know of for this being done; and the reason goes down to the roots of the world. 

These religious pictures are not just dirtied or torn or scrawled over, which might be done in idleness or bigotry, by chil dren or by Protestants. 

These have been treated very carefully — and very queerly. 

In every place where the great ornamented name of God comes in the old illuminations it has been elaborately taken out. 

The only other thing that has been removed is the halo round the head of the Child Jesus. 

Therefore, I say, let us get our warrant and our spade and our hatch et, and go up and break open that coffin.” “What do you mean?” demanded the London of ficer. 

“I mean,” answered the little priest, and his voice seemed to rise slightly in the roar of the gale. 

“I mean that the great devil of the universe may be sitting on the top tower of this castle at this mo ment, as big as a hundred elephants, and roaring like the Apocalypse. 

There is black magic some where at the bottom of this.” “Black magic,” repeated Flambeau in a low voice, for he was too enlightened a man not to know of such things; “but what can these other things mean?” “Oh, something damnable, I suppose,” replied Brown impatiently. 

“How should I know? How can I 143G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON guess all their mazes down below? Perhaps you can make a torture out of snuff and bamboo. 

Perhaps lunatics lust after wax and steel filings. 

Perhaps there is a maddening drug made of lead pencils! Our shortest cut to the mystery is up the hill to the grave.” His comrades hardly knew that they had obeyed and followed him till a blast of the night wind nearly flung them on their faces in the garden. 

Neverthe less they had obeyed him like automata; for Craven found a hatchet in his hand, and the warrant in his pocket; Flambeau was carrying the heavy spade of the strange gardener; Father Brown was carrying the little gilt book from which had been torn the name of God. 

The path up the hill to the churchyard was crooked but short; only under that stress of wind it seemed laborious and long. 

Far as the eye could see, farther and farther as they mounted the slope, were seas beyond seas of pines, now all aslope one way under the wind. 

And that universal gesture seemed as vain as it was vast, as vain as if that wind were whistling about some unpeopled and purposeless planet. 

Through all that infinite growth of grey blue forests sang, shrill and high, that ancient sorrow that is in the heart of all heathen things. 

One could fancy that the voices from the under world of un fathomable foliage were cries of the lost and wan 144THE HONOUR OF ISRAEL GOW dering pagan gods: gods who had gone roaming in that irrational forest, and who will never find their way back to heaven. 

“You see,” said Father Brown in low but easy tone, “Scotch people before Scotland existed were a curious lot. 

In fact, they’re a curious lot still. 

But in the prehistoric times I fancy they really worshipped demons. 

That,” he added genially, “is why they jumped at the Puritan theology.” “My friend,” said Flambeau, turning in a kind of fury, “what does all that snuff mean?” “My friend,” replied Brown, with equal serious ness, “there is one mark of all genuine religions: materialism. 

Now, devil worship is a perfectly genu ine religion.” They had come up on the grassy scalp of the hill, one of the few bald spots that stood clear of the crashing and roaring pine forest. 

A mean enclosure, partly timber and partly wire, rattled in the tempest to tell them the border of the graveyard. 

But by the time Inspector Craven had come to the corner of the grave, and Flambeau had planted his spade point downwards and leaned on it, they were both almost as shaken as the shaky wood and wire. 

At the foot of the grave grew great tall thistles, grey and silver in their decay. 

Once or twice, when a ball of thistle down broke under the breeze and flew past him, Craven jumped slightly as if it had been an arrow. 

145G.

CHESTERTON Flambeau drove the blade of his spade through the whistling grass into the wet clay below. 

Then he seemed to stop and lean on it as on a staff. 

“Go on,” said the priest very gently. 

“We are only trying to find the truth. 

What are you afraid of?” “I am afraid of finding it,” said Flambeau. 

The London detective spoke suddenly in a high crowing voice that was meant to be conversational and cheery. 

“I wonder why he really did hide him self like that. 

Something nasty, I suppose; was he a leper?” “Something worse than that,” said Flambeau. 

“And what do you imagine,” asked the other, “would be worse than a leper?” “I don’t imagine it,” said Flambeau. 

He dug for some dreadful minutes in silence, and then said in a choked voice, “I’m afraid of his not being the right shape.” “Nor was that piece of paper, you know,” said Fa ther Brown quietly, “and we survived even that piece of paper.” Flambeau dug on with a blind energy. 

But the tempest had shouldered away the choking grey clouds that clung to the hills like smoke and re vealed grey fields of faint starlight before he cleared the shape of a rude timber coffin, and somehow tipped it up upon the turf. 

Craven stepped forward with his axe; a thistle top touched him, and he 146THE HONOUR OF ISRAEL GOW flinched. 

Then he took a firmer stride, and hacked and wrenched with an energy like Flambeau’s till the lid was torn off, and all that was there lay glim mering in the grey starlight. 

“Bones,” said Craven; and then he added, “but it is a man,” as if that were something unexpected. 

“Is he,” asked Flambeau in a voice that went odd ly up and down, “is he all right?” “Seems so,” said the officer huskily, bending over the obscure and decaying skeleton in the box. 

“Wait a minute.” A vast heave went over Flambeau’s huge figure. 

“And now I come to think of it,” he cried, “why in the name of madness shouldn’t he be all right? What is it gets hold of a man on these cursed cold mountains? I think it’s the black, brainless repeti tion; all these forests, and over all an ancient horror of unconsciousness. 

It’s like the dream of an atheist. 

Pine trees and more pine trees and millions more pine trees — ” “God!” cried the man by the coffin, “but he hasn’t got a head.” While the others stood rigid the priest, for the first time, showed a leap of startled concern. 

“No head!” he repeated. 

“No head?” as if he had almost expected some other deficiency. 

Half witted visions of a headless baby born to Glengyle, of a headless youth hiding himself in the 147G.

CHESTERTON castle, of a headless man pacing those ancient halls or that gorgeous garden, passed in panorama through their minds. 

But even in that stiffened in stant the tale took no root in them and seemed to have no reason in it. 

They stood listening to the loud woods and the shrieking sky quite foolishly, like exhausted animals. 

Thought seemed to be something enormous that had suddenly slipped out of their grasp. 

“There are three headless men,” said Father Brown, “standing round this open grave.” The pale detective from London opened his mouth to speak, and left it open like a yokel, while a long scream of wind tore the sky; then he looked at the axe in his hands as if it did not belong to him, and dropped it. 

“Father,” said Flambeau in that infantile and heavy voice he used very seldom, “what are we to do?” His friend’s reply came with the pent prompti tude of a gun going off. 

“Sleep!” cried Father Brown. 

“Sleep. 

We have come to the end of the ways. 

Do you know what sleep is? Do you know that every man who sleeps believes in God? It is a sacrament; for it is an act of faith and it is a food. 

And we need a sacrament, if only a natural one. 

Something has fallen on us that falls very seldom on men; perhaps the worst thing that can fall on them.” 148THE HONOUR OF ISRAEL GOW Craven’s parted lips came together to say, “What do you mean?” The priest had turned his face to the castle as he answered: “We have found the truth; and the truth makes no sense.” He went down the path in front of them with a plunging and reckless step very rare with him, and when they reached the castle again he threw himself upon sleep with the simplicity of a dog. 

Despite his mystic praise of slumber, Father Brown was up earlier than anyone else except the si lent gardener; and was found smoking a big pipe and watching that expert at his speechless labours in the kitchen garden. 

Towards daybreak the rocking storm had ended in roaring rains, and the day came with a curious freshness. 

The gardener seemed even to have been conversing, but at sight of the detectives he planted his spade sullenly in a bed and, saying some thing about his breakfast, shifted along the lines of cabbages and shut himself in the kitchen. 

“He’s a valuable man, that,” said Father Brown. 

“He does the potatoes amazingly. 

Still,” he added, with a dispas sionate charity, “he has his faults; which of us hasn’t? He doesn’t dig this bank quite regularly. 

There, for instance,” and he stamped suddenly on one spot. 

“I’m really very doubtful about that potato.” “And why?” asked Craven, amused with the little man’s hobby. 

149G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON “I’m doubtful about it,” said the other, “because old Gow was doubtful about it himself. 

He put his spade in methodically in every place but just this. 

There must be a mighty fine potato just here.” Flambeau pulled up the spade and impetuously drove it into the place. 

He turned up, under a load of soil, something that did not look like a potato, but rather like a monstrous, over domed mush room. 

But it struck the spade with a cold click; it rolled over like a ball, and grinned up at them. 

“The Earl of Glengyle,” said Brown sadly, and looked down heavily at the skull. 

Then, after a momentary meditation, he plucked the spade from Flambeau, and, saying “We must hide it again,” clamped the skull down in the earth. 

Then he leaned his little body and huge head on the great handle of the spade, that stood up stiffly in the earth, and his eyes were empty and his forehead full of wrinkles. 

“If one could only conceive,” he mut tered, “the meaning of this last monstrosity.” And leaning on the large spade handle, he buried his brows in his hands, as men do in church. 

All the corners of the sky were brightening into blue and silver; the birds were chattering in the tiny garden trees; so loud it seemed as if the trees them selves were talking. 

But the three men were silent enough. 

“Well, I give it all up,” said Flambeau at last bois terously. 

“My brain and this world don’t fit each 1501 THE HONOUR OF ISRAEL GOW other; and there’s an end of it. 

Snuff, spoilt Prayer Books, and the insides of musical boxes — what — ” Brown threw up his bothered brow and rapped on the spade handle with an intolerance quite unusual with him. 

“Oh, tut, tut, tut, tut!” he cried. 

“All that is as plain as a pikestaff. 

I understood the snuff and clockwork, and so on, when I first opened my eyes this morning. 

And since then I’ve had it out with old Gow, the gardener, who is neither so deaf nor so stu pid as he pretends. 

There’s nothing amiss about the loose items. 

I was wrong about the torn mass book, too; there’s no harm in that. 

But it’s this last business. 

Desecrating graves and stealing dead men’s heads — surely there’s harm in that? Surely there’s black mag ic still in that? That doesn’t fit in to the quite simple story of the snuff and the candles.” And, striding about again, he smoked moodily. 

“My friend,” said Flambeau, with a grim humour, “you must be careful with me and remember I was once a criminal. 

The great advantage of that estate was that I always made up the story myself, and act ed it as quick as I chose. 

This detective business of waiting about is too much for my French impa tience. 

All my life, for good or evil, I have done things at the instant; I always fought duels the next morning; I always paid bills on the nail1; I never even put off a visit to the dentist — ” paid bills on the nail — (разг.) расплачиваться сразу 151G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON Father Brown’s pipe fell out of his mouth and broke into three pieces on the gravel path. 

He stood rolling his eyes, the exact picture of an idiot. 

“Lord, what a turnip I am!” he kept saying. 

“Lord, what a turnip1!” Then, in a somewhat groggy kind of way, he began to laugh. 

“The dentist!” he repeated. 

“Six hours in the spirit ual abyss, and all because I never thought of the dentist! Such a simple, such a beautiful and peaceful thought! Friends, we have passed a night in hell; but now the sun is risen, the birds are singing, and the radiant form of the dentist consoles the world.” “I will get some sense out of this,” cried Flam beau, striding forward, “if I use the tortures of the Inquisition2.” Father Brown repressed what appeared to be a momentary disposition to dance on the now sunlit lawn and cried quite piteously, like a child, “Oh, let me be silly a little. 

You don’t know how unhappy I have been. 

And now I know that there has been no deep sin in this business at all. 

Only a little lunacy, perhaps — and who minds that?” He spun round once more, then faced them with gravity.

We are dealing with the one man on earth, perhaps, who has taken no more than his due. 

It is a study in the savage living logic that has been the religion of this race. 

That old local rhyme about the house of Glengyle — was literal as well as metaphorical. 

It did not merely mean that the Glengyles sought for wealth; it was also true that they literally gathered gold; they had a huge collection of ornaments and uten sils in that metal. 

They were, in fact, misers whose mania took that turn. 

In the light of that fact, run through all the things we found in the castle. 

Dia monds without their gold rings; candles without their gold candlesticks; snuff without the gold snuff boxes; pencil leads without the gold pencil cases; a walking stick without its gold top; clock work without the gold clocks — or rather watches. 

And, mad as it sounds, because the halos and the name of God in the old missals were of real gold; these also were taken away.” The garden seemed to brighten, the grass to grow gayer in the strengthening sun, as the crazy truth was told. 

Flambeau lit a cigarette as his friend went on. 

153G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON “Were taken away,” continued Father Brown; “were taken away — but not stolen. 

Thieves would never have left this mystery. 

Thieves would have taken the gold snuff boxes, snuff and all; the gold pencil cases, lead and all. 

We have to deal with a man with a peculiar conscience, but certainly a con science. 

I found that mad moralist this morning in the kitchen garden yonder, and I heard the whole story. 

“The late Archibald Ogilvie was the nearest ap proach to a good man ever born at Glengyle. 

But his bitter virtue took the turn of the misanthrope; he moped over the dishonesty of his ancestors, from which, somehow, he generalised a dishonesty of all men. 

More especially he distrusted philanthropy or free giving; and he swore if he could find one man who took his exact rights he should have all the gold of Glengyle. 

Having delivered this defiance to hu manity he shut himself up, without the smallest ex pectation of its being answered. 

One day, however, a deaf and seemingly senseless lad from a distant vil lage brought him a belated telegram; and Glengyle, in his acrid pleasantry, gave him a new farthing. 

At least he thought he had done so, but when he turned over his change he found the new farthing still there and a sovereign gone. 

The accident of fered him vistas of sneering speculation. 

Either way, the boy would show the greasy greed of the species. 

154THE HONOUR OF ISRAEL GOW Either he would vanish, a thief stealing a coin; or he would sneak back with it virtuously, a snob seeking a reward. 

In the middle of that night Lord Glengyle was knocked up out of his bed — for he lived alone — and forced to open the door to the deaf idi ot. 

The idiot brought with him, not the sovereign, but exactly nineteen shillings and eleven pence three farthings in change. 

Then the wild exactitude of this action took hold of the mad lord’s brain like fire. 

He swore he was Diogenes1, that had long sought an honest man, and at last had found one. 

He made a new will, which I have seen. 

He took the literal youth into his huge, neglected house, and trained him up as his solitary servant and — after an odd manner — his heir. 

And whatever that queer creature understands, he understood absolutely his lord’s two fixed ideas: first, that the letter of right is everything; and sec ond, that he himself was to have the gold of Glengyle. 

So far, that is all; and that is simple. 

He has stripped the house of gold, and taken not a grain that was not gold; not so much as a grain of snuff. 

He lifted the gold leaf off an old illumination, 1 Diogenes — Диоген Синопский, древнегреческий фи лософ киник, практиковал крайний аскетизм, доходящий до эксцентрического юродства.

K. 

CHESTERTON fully satisfied that he left the rest unspoilt. 

All that I understood; but I could not understand this skull business. 

I was really uneasy about that human head buried among the potatoes. 

It distressed me — till Flambeau said the word. 

“It will be all right. 

He will put the skull back in the grave, when he has taken the gold out of the tooth.” And, indeed, when Flambeau crossed the hill that morning, he saw that strange being, the just miser, digging at the desecrated grave, the plaid round his throat thrashing out in the mountain wind; the sober top hat on his head.The Sign of the Broken Sword T HE thousand arms of the forest were grey, and its million fingers silver. 

In a sky of dark green blue like slate the stars were bleak and bril liant like splintered ice. 

All that thickly wooded and sparsely tenanted countryside was stiff with a bitter and brittle frost. 

The black hollows between the trunks of the trees looked like bottomless, black caverns of that Scandinavian hell, a hell of incalcu lable cold. 

Even the square stone tower of the church looked northern to the point of heathenry, as if it were some barbaric tower among the sea rocks of Iceland. 

It was a queer night for anyone to explore a churchyard. 

But, on the other hand, perhaps it was worth exploring. 

It rose abruptly out of the ashen wastes of forest in a sort of hump or shoulder of green turf that looked grey in the starlight. 

Most of the graves were on a slant, and the path leading up to the church was as steep as a staircase. 

On the top of the hill, in the one flat and prominent place, was the monu 157G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON ment for which the place was famous. 

It contrasted strangely with the featureless graves all round, for it was the work of one of the greatest sculptors of modern Europe; and yet his fame was at once for gotten in the fame of the man whose image he had made. 

It showed, by touches of the small silver pencil of starlight, the massive metal figure of a soldier re cumbent, the strong hands sealed in an everlasting worship, the great head pillowed upon a gun. 

The venerable face was bearded, or rather whiskered, in the old, heavy Colonel Newcome fashion. 

The uni form, though suggested with the few strokes of sim plicity, was that of modern war. 

By his right side lay a sword, of which the tip was broken off; on the left side lay a Bible. 

On glowing summer afternoons wagonettes came full of Americans and cultured suburbans to see the sepulchre; but even then they felt the vast forest land with its one dumpy dome of churchyard and church as a place oddly dumb and neglected. 

In this freezing darkness of mid winter one would think he might be left alone with the stars. 

Nevertheless, in the stillness of those stiff woods a wooden gate creaked, and two dim figures dressed in black climbed up the little path to the tomb. 

So faint was that frigid starlight that nothing could have been traced about them except that while they both wore black, one man was enor 158THE SIGN OF THE BROKEN SWORD mously big, and the other (perhaps by contrast) al most startlingly small. 

They went up to the great graven tomb of the historic warrior, and stood for a few minutes staring at it. 

There was no human, perhaps no living, thing for a wide circle; and a morbid fancy might well have wondered if they were human themselves. 

In any case, the beginning of their conversation might have seemed strange. 

After the first silence the small man said to the other: “Where does a wise man hide a pebble?” And the tall man answered in a low voice: “On the beach.” The small man nodded, and after a short silence said: “Where does a wise man hide a leaf?” And the other answered: “In the forest.” There was another stillness, and then the tall man resumed: “Do you mean that when a wise man has to hide a real diamond he has been known to hide it among sham ones?” “No, no,” said the little man with a laugh, “we will let bygones be bygones1.” He stamped his cold feet for a second or two, and then said: “I’m not thinking of that at all, but of something else; something rather peculiar. 

Just strike a match, will you?” 1 let bygones be bygones — (ср. 

русск.) кто старое по мянет, тому глаз вон 159G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON The big man fumbled in his pocket, and soon a scratch and a flare painted gold the whole flat side of the monument. 

On it was cut in black letters the well known words which so many Americans had reverently read: “Sacred to the Memory of General Sir Arthur St. 

Clare, Hero and Martyr, who Always Vanquished his Enemies and Always Spared Them, and Was Treacherously Slain by Them At Last. 

May God in Whom he Trusted both Reward and Revenge him.” The match burnt the big man’s fingers, black ened, and dropped. 

He was about to strike another, but his small companion stopped him. 

“That’s all right, Flambeau, old man; I saw what I wanted. 

Or, rather, I didn’t see what I didn’t want. 

And now we must walk a mile and a half along the road to the next inn, and I will try to tell you all about it. 

For Heaven knows a man should have a fire and ale when he dares tell such a story.” They descended the precipitous path, they relatched the rusty gate, and set off at a stamping, ringing walk down the frozen forest road. 

They had gone a full quarter of a mile before the smaller man spoke again. 

He said: “Yes; the wise man hides a pebble on the beach. 

But what does he do if there is 160THE SIGN OF THE BROKEN SWORD no beach? Do you know anything of that great St. 

Clare trouble?” “I know nothing about English generals, Father Brown,” answered the large man, laughing, “though a little about English policemen. 

I only know that you have dragged me a precious long dance to all the shrines of this fellow, whoever he is. 

One would think he got buried in six different places.

Clare in Westminster Ab bey. 

I’ve seen a ramping equestrian statue of General St. 

Clare on the Embankment. 

I’ve seen a medallion of St. 

Clare in the street he was born in, and another in the street he lived in; and now you drag me after dark to his coffin in the village churchyard. 

I am be ginning to be a bit tired of his magnificent personal ity, especially as I don’t in the least know who he was. 

What are you hunting for in all these crypts and effigies?” “I am only looking for one word,” said Father Brown. 

“A word that isn’t there.” “Well,” asked Flambeau; “are you going to tell me anything about it?” “I must divide it into two parts,” remarked the priest. 

“First there is what everybody knows; and then there is what I know. 

Now, what everybody knows is short and plain enough. 

It is also entirely wrong.” “Right you are,” said the big man called Flam beau cheerfully. 

“Let’s begin at the wrong end. 

Let’s 161G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON begin with what everybody knows, which isn’t true.” “If not wholly untrue, it is at least very inade quate,” continued Brown; “for in point of fact, all that the public knows amounts precisely to this: the public knows that Arthur St. 

Clare was a great and successful English general. 

It knows that after splendid yet careful campaigns both in India and Africa he was in command against Brazil when the great Brazilian patriot Olivier issued his ultimatum. 

It knows that on that occasion St. 

Clare with a very small force attacked Olivier with a very large one, and was captured after heroic resistance. 

And it knows that after his capture, and to the abhorrence of the civilised world, St. 

Clare was hanged on the nearest tree. 

He was found swinging there after the Brazilians had retired, with his broken sword hung round his neck.” “And that popular story is untrue?” suggested Flambeau. 

“No,” said his friend quietly, “that story is quite true, so far as it goes.” “Well, I think it goes far enough!” said Flambeau; “but if the popular story is true, what is the mys tery?” They had passed many hundreds of grey and ghostly trees before the little priest answered. 

Then he bit his finger reflectively and said: “Why, the 1621 THE SIGN OF THE BROKEN SWORD mystery is a mystery of psychology. 

Or, rather, it is a mystery of two psychologies. 

In that Brazilian busi ness two of the most famous men of modern history acted flat against their characters. 

Mind you, Olivier and St. 

Clare were both heroes — the old thing, and no mistake; it was like the fight between Hector and Achilles1. 

Now, what would you say to an affair in which Achilles was timid and Hector was treacher ous?” “Go on,” said the large man impatiently as the other bit his finger again. 

“Sir Arthur St. 

Clare was a soldier of the old reli gious type — the type that saved us during the Mu tiny,” continued Brown. 

“He was always more for duty than for dash; and with all his personal cour age was decidedly a prudent commander, particu larly indignant at any needless waste of soldiers. 

Yet in this last battle he attempted something that a baby could see was absurd. 

One need not be a strat egist to see it was as wild as wind; just as one need not be a strategist to keep out of the way of a motor bus. 

Well, that is the first mystery; what had become of the English general’s head? The second riddle is, what had become of the Brazilian general’s heart? President Olivier might be called a visionary or a nuisance; but even his enemies admitted that he was Hector and Achilles — герои «Илиады» Гомера 163G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON magnanimous to the point of knight errantry. 

Almost every other prisoner he had ever captured had been set free or even loaded with benefits. 

Men who had really wronged him came away touched by his simplicity and sweetness. 

Why the deuce should he diabolically revenge himself only once in his life; and that for the one particular blow that could not have hurt him? Well, there you have it. 

One of the wisest men in the world acted like an idiot for no reason. 

One of the best men in the world acted like a fiend for no reason1. 

That’s the long and the short of it2; and I leave it to you, my boy.” “No, you don’t,” said the other with a snort. 

“I leave it to you; and you jolly well tell me all about it.” “Well,” resumed Father Brown, “it’s not fair to say that the public impression is just what I’ve said, without adding that two things have happened since. 

I can’t say they threw a new light; for nobody can make sense of them. 

But they threw a new kind of darkness; they threw the darkness in new direc tions. 

The first was this. 

The family physician of the St. 

Clares quarrelled with that family, and began publishing a violent series of articles, in which he said that the late general was a religious maniac; but 1 for no reason — (разг.) без всякой видимой причины That’s the long and the short of it —(разг.) Вот вам и весь рассказ 2 164THE SIGN OF THE BROKEN SWORD as far as the tale went, this seemed to mean little more than a religious man. 

Anyhow, the story fiz zled out. 

Everyone knew, of course, that St. 

Clare had some of the eccentricities of puritan piety. 

The second incident was much more arresting. 

In the luckless and unsupported regiment which made that rash attempt at the Black River there was a certain Captain Keith, who was at that time engaged to St. 

Clare’s daughter, and who afterwards married her. 

He was one of those who were captured by Olivier, and, like all the rest except the general, appears to have been bounteously treated and promptly set free. 

Some twenty years afterwards this man, then Lieutenant Colonel Keith, published a sort of auto biography called ‘A British Officer in Burmah and Brazil.’ In the place where the reader looks eagerly for some account of the mystery of St. 

Clare’s disas ter may be found the following words: ‘Everywhere else in this book I have narrated things exactly as they occurred, holding as I do the old fashioned opinion that the glory of England is old enough to take care of itself. 

The exception I shall make is in this matter of the defeat by the Black River; and my reasons, though private, are honourable and com pelling. 

I will, however, add this in justice to the memories of two distinguished men. 

General St. 

Clare has been accused of incapacity on this oc casion; I can at least testify that this action, properly 165G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON understood, was one of the most brilliant and saga cious of his life. 

President Olivier by similar report is charged with savage injustice. 

I think it due to the honour of an enemy to say that he acted on this oc casion with even more than his characteristic good feeling. 

To put the matter popularly, I can assure my countrymen that St. 

Clare was by no means such a fool nor Olivier such a brute as he looked. 

This is all I have to say; nor shall any earthly consideration in duce me to add a word to it.’” A large frozen moon like a lustrous snowball be gan to show through the tangle of twigs in front of them, and by its light the narrator had been able to refresh his memory of Captain Keith’s text from a scrap of printed paper. 

As he folded it up and put it back in his pocket Flambeau threw up his hand with a French gesture. 

“Wait a bit, wait a bit,” he cried excitedly. 

“I be lieve I can guess it at the first go1.” He strode on, breathing hard, his black head and bull neck forward, like a man winning a walking race. 

The little priest, amused and interested, had some trouble in trotting beside him. 

Just before them the trees fell back a little to left and right, and the road swept downwards across a clear, moonlit valley, till it dived again like a rabbit into the wall of 1 166 at the first go — (разг.) с первой попыткиTHE SIGN OF THE BROKEN SWORD another wood. 

The entrance to the farther forest looked small and round, like the black hole of a re mote railway tunnel. 

But it was within some hun dred yards, and gaped like a cavern before Flambeau spoke again. 

“I’ve got it,” he cried at last, slapping his thigh with his great hand. 

“Four minutes’ thinking, and I can tell your whole story myself.” “All right,” assented his friend. 

“You tell it.” Flambeau lifted his head, but lowered his voice. 

“General Sir Arthur St. 

Clare,” he said, “came of a family in which madness was hereditary; and his whole aim was to keep this from his daughter, and even, if possible, from his future son in law. 

Rightly or wrongly, he thought the final collapse was close, and resolved on suicide. 

Yet ordinary suicide would blazon the very idea he dreaded. 

As the campaign approached the clouds came thicker on his brain; and at last in a mad moment he sacrificed his public duty to his private. 

He rushed rashly into battle, hoping to fall by the first shot. 

When he found that he had only attained capture and discredit, the sealed bomb in his brain burst, and he broke his own sword and hanged himself.” He stared firmly at the grey façade of forest in front of him, with the one black gap in it, like the mouth of the grave, into which their path plunged. 

Perhaps something menacing in the road thus sud 167G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON denly swallowed reinforced his vivid vision of the tragedy, for he shuddered. 

“A horrid story,” he said. 

“A horrid story,” repeated the priest with bent head. 

“But not the real story.” Then he threw back his head with a sort of de spair and cried: “Oh, I wish it had been.” The tall Flambeau faced round and stared at him. 

“Yours is a clean story,” cried Father Brown, deeply moved. 

“A sweet, pure, honest story, as open and white as that moon. 

Madness and despair are innocent enough. 

There are worse things, Flam beau.” Flambeau looked up wildly at the moon thus in voked; and from where he stood one black tree bough curved across it exactly like a devil’s horn. 

“Father — father,” cried Flambeau with the French gesture and stepping yet more rapidly for ward, “do you mean it was worse than that?” “Worse than that,” said the other like a grave echo. 

And they plunged into the black cloister of the woodland, which ran by them in a dim tapestry of trunks, like one of the dark corridors in a dream. 

They were soon in the most secret entrails of the wood, and felt close about them foliage that they could not see, when the priest said again: “Where does a wise man hide a leaf? In the forest. 

But what does he do if there is no forest?” 168THE SIGN OF THE BROKEN SWORD “Well, well,” cried Flambeau irritably, “what does he do?” “He grows a forest to hide it in,” said the priest in an obscure voice. 

“A fearful sin.” “Look here,” cried his friend impatiently, for the dark wood and the dark saying got a little on his nerves; “will you tell me this story or not? What oth er evidence is there to go on?” “There are three more bits of evidence,” said the other, “that I have dug up in holes and corners; and I will give them in logical rather than chronological order. 

First of all, of course, our authority for the is sue and event of the battle is in Olivier’s own dis patches, which are lucid enough. 

He was en trenched with two or three regiments on the heights that swept down to the Black River, on the other side of which was lower and more marshy ground. 

Beyond this again was gently rising country, on which was the first English outpost, supported by others which lay, however, considerably in its rear. 

The British forces as a whole were greatly superior in numbers1; but this particular regiment was just far enough from its base to make Olivier consider the project of crossing the river to cut it off. 

By sun set, however, he had decided to retain his own posi 1 superior in numbers — (разг.) имели численное пре имущество 169G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON tion, which was a specially strong one. 

At daybreak next morning he was thunderstruck to see that this stray handful of English, entirely unsupported from their rear, had flung themselves across the river, half by a bridge to the right, and the other half by a ford higher up, and were massed upon the marshy bank below him. 

“That they should attempt an attack with such numbers against such a position was incredible enough; but Olivier noticed something yet more ex traordinary. 

For instead of attempting to seize more solid ground, this mad regiment, having put the river in its rear by one wild charge, did nothing more, but stuck there in the mire like flies in treacle. 

Needless to say, the Brazilians blew great gaps in them with artillery, which they could only return with spirited but lessening rifle fire. 

Yet they never broke; and Olivier’s curt account ends with a strong tribute of admiration for the mystic valour of these imbeciles. 

‘Our line then advanced finally,’ writes Olivier, ‘and drove them into the river; we captured General St. 

Clare himself and several other officers. 

The colonel and the major had both fallen in the battle. 

I cannot resist saying that few finer sights can have been seen in history than the last stand of this extraordinary regiment; wounded officers pick ing up the rifles of dead soldiers, and the general himself facing us on horseback bareheaded and 170THE SIGN OF THE BROKEN SWORD with a broken sword.’ On what happened to the general afterwards Olivier is as silent as Captain Keith.” “Well,” grunted Flambeau, “get on to the next bit of evidence.” “The next evidence,” said Father Brown, “took some time to find, but it will not take long to tell. 

I found at last in an almshouse down in the Lin colnshire Fens an old soldier who not only was wounded at the Black River, but had actually knelt beside the colonel of the regiment when he died. 

This latter was a certain Colonel Clancy, a big bull of an Irishman; and it would seem that he died al most as much of rage as of bullets. 

He, at any rate, was not responsible for that ridiculous raid; it must have been imposed on him by the general. 

His last edifying words, according to my informant, were these: ‘And there goes the damned old donkey with the end of his sword knocked off. 

I wish it was his head.’ You will remark that everyone seems to have noticed this detail about the broken sword blade, though most people regard it somewhat more rever ently than did the late Colonel Clancy. 

And now for the third fragment.” Their path through the woodland began to go upward, and the speaker paused a little for breath before he went on. 

Then he continued in the same businesslike tone: 171G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON “Only a month or two ago a certain Brazilian of ficial died in England, having quarrelled with Olivi er and left his country. 

He was a well known figure both here and on the Continent, a Spaniard named Espado; I knew him myself, a yellow faced old dan dy, with a hooked nose. 

For various private reasons I had permission to see the documents he had left; he was a Catholic, of course, and I had been with him towards the end. 

There was nothing of his that lit up any corner of the black St.

I can only sup pose that it was found by the Brazilians on one of those that fell. 

Anyhow, it stopped abruptly the night before the battle. 

“But the account of that last day in the poor fel low’s life was certainly worth reading. 

I have it on me1; but it’s too dark to read it here, and I will give you a resume. 

The first part of that entry is full of jokes, evidently flung about among the men, about somebody called the Vulture. 

It does not seem as if this person, whoever he was, was one of themselves, nor even an Englishman; neither is he exactly spo ken of as one of the enemy. 

It sounds rather as if he were some local go between and non combatant; perhaps a guide or a journalist. 

He has been closet 1 172 I have it on me — (разг.) Он у меня с собойTHE SIGN OF THE BROKEN SWORD ed with old Colonel Clancy; but is more often seen talking to the major. 

Indeed, the major is somewhat prominent in this soldier’s narrative; a lean, dark haired man, apparently, of the name of Murray — a north of Ireland man and a Puritan. 

There are con tinual jests about the contrast between this Ulster man’s austerity and the conviviality of Colonel Clancy. 

There is also some joke about the Vulture wearing bright coloured clothes. 

“But all these levities are scattered by what may well be called the note of a bugle. 

Behind the Eng lish camp and almost parallel to the river ran one of the few great roads of that district. 

Westward the road curved round towards the river, which it crossed by the bridge before mentioned. 

To the east the road swept backwards into the wilds, and some two miles along it was the next English outpost. 

From this direction there came along the road that evening a glitter and clatter of light cavalry, in which even the simple diarist could recognise with astonishment the general with his staff. 

He rode the great white horse which you have seen so often in il lustrated papers and Academy pictures; and you may be sure that the salute they gave him was not merely ceremonial. 

He, at least, wasted no time on ceremony, but, springing from the saddle immedi ately, mixed with the group of officers, and fell into emphatic though confidential speech. 

What struck 173G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON our friend the diarist most was his special disposi tion to discuss matters with Major Murray; but, in deed, such a selection, so long as it was not marked, was in no way unnatural. 

The two men were made for sympathy; they were men who ‘read their Bibles’; they were both the old Evangelical type of officer. 

However this may be, it is certain that when the general mounted again he was still talking earnestly to Murray; and that as he walked his horse slowly down the road towards the river, the tall Ulsterman still walked by his bridle rein in earnest debate. 

The soldiers watched the two until they vanished behind a clump of trees where the road turned towards the river. 

The colonel had gone back to his tent, and the men to their pickets; the man with the diary lin gered for another four minutes, and saw a marvel lous sight. 

“The great white horse which had marched slow ly down the road, as it had marched in so many pro cessions, flew back, galloping up the road towards them as if it were mad to win a race. 

At first they thought it had run away with the man on its back; but they soon saw that the general, a fine rider, was himself urging it to full speed. 

Horse and man swept up to them like a whirlwind; and then, reining up the reeling charger, the general turned on them a face like flame, and called for the colonel like the trumpet that wakes the dead. 

174THE SIGN OF THE BROKEN SWORD “I conceive that all the earthquake events of that catastrophe tumbled on top of each other rather like lumber in the minds of men such as our friend with the diary. 

With the dazed excitement of a dream, they found themselves falling — literally falling — into their ranks, and learned that an attack was to be led at once across the river. 

The general and the major, it was said, had found out something at the bridge, and there was only just time to strike for life. 

The major had gone back at once to call up the re serve along the road behind; it was doubtful if even with that prompt appeal help could reach them in time. 

But they must pass the stream that night, and seize the heights by morning. 

It is with the very stir and throb of that romantic nocturnal march that the diary suddenly ends.” Father Brown had mounted ahead; for the wood land path grew smaller, steeper, and more twisted, till they felt as if they were ascending a winding staircase. 

The priest’s voice came from above out of the darkness. 

“There was one other little and enormous thing. 

When the general urged them to their chivalric charge he half drew his sword from the scabbard; and then, as if ashamed of such melodrama, thrust it back again. 

The sword again, you see.” A half light broke through the network of boughs above them, flinging the ghost of a net 175G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON about their feet; for they were mounting again to the faint luminosity of the naked night. 

Flambeau felt truth all round him as an atmosphere, but not as an idea. 

He answered with bewildered brain: “Well, what’s the matter with the sword? Officers generally have swords, don’t they?” “They are not often mentioned in modern war,” said the other dispassionately; “but in this affair one falls over the blessed sword everywhere.” “Well, what is there in that?” growled Flambeau; “it was a twopence coloured sort of incident; the old man’s blade breaking in his last battle. 

Anyone might bet the papers would get hold of it, as they have. 

On all these tombs and things it’s shown broken at the point. 

I hope you haven’t dragged me through this Polar expedition merely because two men with an eye for a picture1 saw St. 

Clare’s broken sword.” “No,” cried Father Brown, with a sharp voice like a pistol shot; “but who saw his unbroken sword?” “What do you mean?” cried the other, and stood still under the stars. 

They had come abruptly out of the grey gates of the wood. 

“I say, who saw his unbroken sword?” repeated Father Brown obstinately. 

“Not the writer of the di ary, anyhow; the general sheathed it in time.” 1 with an eye for a picture — (разг.) которые привыкли все подмечать 176THE SIGN OF THE BROKEN SWORD Flambeau looked about him in the moonlight, as a man struck blind might look in the sun; and his friend went on, for the first time with eagerness: “Flambeau,” he cried, “I cannot prove it, even af ter hunting through the tombs. 

But I am sure of it. 

Let me add just one more tiny fact that tips the whole thing over1. 

The colonel, by a strange chance, was one of the first struck by a bullet. 

He was struck long before the troops came to close quarters. 

But he saw St. 

Clare’s sword broken. 

Why was it bro ken? How was it broken? My friend, it was broken before the battle.” “Oh!” said his friend, with a sort of forlorn jocu larity; “and pray where is the other piece?” “I can tell you,” said the priest promptly. 

“In the north east corner of the cemetery of the Protestant Cathedral at Belfast.” “Indeed?” inquired the other. 

“Have you looked for it?” “I couldn’t,” replied Brown, with frank regret. 

“There’s a great marble monument on top of it; a mon ument to the heroic Major Murray, who fell fighting gloriously at the famous Battle of the Black River.” Flambeau seemed suddenly galvanised into exist ence. 

“You mean,” he cried hoarsely, “that General 1 that tips the whole thing over — (разг.) который про яснит всю картину 177G.

Clare hated Murray, and murdered him on the field of battle because — ” “You are still full of good and pure thoughts,” said the other. 

“It was worse than that.” “Well,” said the large man, “my stock of evil im agination is used up.” The priest seemed really doubtful where to be gin, and at last he said again: “Where would a wise man hide a leaf? In the for est.” The other did not answer. 

“If there were no forest, he would make a forest. 

And if he wished to hide a dead leaf, he would make a dead forest.” There was still no reply, and the priest added still more mildly and quietly: “And if a man had to hide a dead body, he would make a field of dead bodies to hide it in.” Flambeau began to stamp forward with an intol erance of delay in time or space; but Father Brown went on as if he were continuing the last sentence: “Sir Arthur St. 

Clare, as I have already said, was a man who read his Bible. 

That was what was the matter with him. 

When will people understand that it is useless for a man to read his Bible unless he also reads everybody else’s Bible? A printer reads a Bible for misprints. 

A Mormon reads his Bible, and finds polygamy; a Christian Scientist reads his, and finds 178THE SIGN OF THE BROKEN SWORD we have no arms and legs. 

St. 

Clare was an old Anglo Indian Protestant soldier. 

Now, just think what that might mean; and, for Heaven’s sake, don’t cant about it. 

It might mean a man physically formi dable living under a tropic sun in an Oriental socie ty, and soaking himself without sense or guidance in an Oriental Book. 

Of course, he read the Old Testa ment rather than the New. 

Of course, he found in the Old Testament1 anything that he wanted — lust, tyranny, treason. 

Oh, I dare say he was honest, as you call it. 

But what is the good of a man being hon est in his worship of dishonesty? “In each of the hot and secret countries to which the man went he kept a harem, he tortured witness es, he amassed shameful gold; but certainly he would have said with steady eyes that he did it to the glory of the Lord. 

My own theology is sufficiently expressed by asking which Lord? Anyhow, there is this about such evil, that it opens door after door in hell, and always into smaller and smaller chambers. 

This is the real case against crime, that a man does not become wilder and wilder, but only meaner and meaner. 

St. 

Clare was soon suffocated by difficulties of bribery and blackmail; and needed more and more cash.

“I mean that,” retorted the cleric, and suddenly pointed at a puddle sealed with ice that shone in the moon. 

“Do you remember whom Dante put in the last circle of ice?” “The traitors,” said Flambeau, and shuddered. 

As he looked around at the inhuman landscape of trees, with taunting and almost obscene outlines, he could almost fancy he was Dante, and the priest with the rivulet of a voice was, indeed, a Virgil2 leading him through a land of eternal sins. 

The voice went on: “Olivier, as you know, was quixotic, and would not permit a secret service and spies. 

The thing, however, was done, like many oth er things, behind his back. 

It was managed by my old friend Espado; he was the bright clad fop, whose hook nose got him called the Vulture. 

Posing as a sort of philanthropist at the front, he felt his way through the English Army, and at last got his fingers on its one corrupt man — please God! — and 1 Dante — Данте Алигьери (1265–1321), итальянский поэт, создатель итальянского литературного языка.

St. 

Clare was in foul need of money, and mountains of it. 

The discredited family doctor was threatening those extraordinary expo sures that afterwards began and were broken off; tales of monstrous and prehistoric things in Park Lane; things done by an English Evangelist that smelt like human sacrifice and hordes of slaves. 

Money was wanted, too, for his daughter’s dowry; for to him the fame of wealth was as sweet as wealth itself. 

He snapped the last thread, whispered the word to Brazil, and wealth poured in from the ene mies of England. 

But another man had talked to Es pado the Vulture as well as he. 

Somehow the dark, grim young major from Ulster had guessed the hid eous truth; and when they walked slowly together down that road towards the bridge Murray was tell ing the general that he must resign instantly, or be court martialled1 and shot. 

The general temporised with him till they came to the fringe of tropic trees by the bridge; and there by the singing river and the sunlit palms (for I can see the picture) the general drew his sabre and plunged it through the body of the major.” The wintry road curved over a ridge in cutting frost, with cruel black shapes of bush and thicket; 1 be courtmartialled — быть преданным военно по левому суду; предстать перед трибуналом 181G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON but Flambeau fancied that he saw beyond it faintly the edge of an aureole that was not starlight and moonlight, but some fire such as is made by men. 

He watched it as the tale drew to its close. 

“St. 

Clare was a hell hound, but he was a hound of breed. 

Never, I’ll swear, was he so lucid and so strong as when poor Murray lay a cold lump at his feet. 

Never in all his triumphs, as Captain Keith said truly, was the great man so great as he was in this last world despised defeat. 

He looked coolly at his weapon to wipe off the blood; he saw the point he had planted between his victim’s shoulders had broken off in the body. 

He saw quite calmly, as through a club windowpane, all that must follow. 

He saw that men must find the unaccountable corpse; must extract the unaccountable sword point; must notice the unaccountable broken sword — or absence of sword. 

He had killed, but not silenced. 

But his imperious intellect rose against the facer; there was one way yet. 

He could make the corpse less unaccountable. 

He could create a hill of corpses to cover this one. 

In twenty minutes eight hundred English soldiers were marching down to their death.” The warmer glow behind the black winter wood grew richer and brighter, and Flambeau strode on to reach it. 

Father Brown also quickened his stride; but he seemed merely absorbed in his tale. 

182THE SIGN OF THE BROKEN SWORD “Such was the valour of that English thousand, and such the genius of their commander, that if they had at once attacked the hill, even their mad march might have met some luck. 

But the evil mind that played with them like pawns had other aims and reasons. 

They must remain in the marshes by the bridge at least till British corpses should be a com mon sight there. 

Then for the last grand scene; the silver haired soldier saint would give up his shat tered sword to save further slaughter. 

Oh, it was well organised for an impromptu. 

But I think (I cannot prove), I think that it was while they stuck there in the bloody mire that someone doubted — and someone guessed.” He was mute a moment, and then said: “There is a voice from nowhere that tells me the man who guessed was the lover .

. 

the man to wed the old man’s child.” “But what about Olivier and the hanging?” asked Flambeau. 

“Olivier, partly from chivalry, partly from policy, seldom encumbered his march with captives,” ex plained the narrator. 

“He released everybody in most cases. 

He released everybody in this case.” “Everybody but the general,” said the tall man. 

“Everybody,” said the priest. 

Flambeau knit his black brows. 

“I don’t grasp it all yet,” he said. 

183G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON “There is another picture, Flambeau,” said Brown in his more mystical undertone. 

“I can’t prove it; but I can do more — I can see it. 

There is a camp breaking up on the bare, torrid hills at morn ing, and Brazilian uniforms massed in blocks and columns to march. 

There is the red shirt and long black beard of Olivier, which blows as he stands, his broad brimmed hat in his hand. 

He is saying fare well to the great enemy he is setting free — the sim ple, snow headed English veteran, who thanks him in the name of his men. 

The English remnant stand behind at attention1; beside them are stores and ve hicles for the retreat. 

The drums roll; the Brazilians are moving; the English are still like statues. 

So they abide till the last hum and flash of the enemy have faded from the tropic horizon. 

Then they alter their postures all at once, like dead men coming to life; they turn their fifty faces upon the general — faces not to be forgotten.” Flambeau gave a great jump. 

“Ah,” he cried, “you don’t mean — ” “Yes,” said Father Brown in a deep, moving voice. 

“It was an English hand that put the rope round St. 

Clare’s neck; I believe the hand that put the ring on his daughter’s finger. 

They were English hands that dragged him up to the tree of shame; the 1 184 stand behind at attention — стояли смирноTHE SIGN OF THE BROKEN SWORD hands of men that had adored him and followed him to victory. 

And they were English souls (God par don and endure us all!) who stared at him swinging in that foreign sun on the green gallows of palm, and prayed in their hatred that he might drop off it into hell.” As the two topped the ridge there burst on them the strong scarlet light of a red curtained English inn. 

It stood sideways in the road, as if standing aside in the amplitude of hospitality. 

Its three doors stood open with invitation; and even where they stood they could hear the hum and laughter of hu manity happy for a night. 

“I need not tell you more,” said Father Brown. 

“They tried him in the wilderness and destroyed him; and then, for the honour of England and of his daughter, they took an oath to seal up for ever the story of the traitor’s purse and the assassin’s sword blade. 

Perhaps — Heaven help them — they tried to forget it. 

Let us try to forget it, anyhow; here is our inn.” “With all my heart,” said Flambeau, and was just striding into the bright, noisy bar when he stepped back and almost fell on the road. 

“Look there, in the devil’s name!” he cried, and pointed rigidly at the square wooden sign that over hung the road. 

It showed dimly the crude shape of a sabre hilt and a shortened blade; and was inscribed 185G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON in false archaic lettering, “The Sign of the Broken Sword.” “Were you not prepared?” asked Father Brown gently. 

“He is the god of this country; half the inns and parks and streets are named after him and his story.” “I thought we had done with the leper,” cried Flambeau, and spat on the road. 

“You will never have done with him in England,” said the priest, looking down, “while brass is strong and stone abides. 

His marble statues will erect the souls of proud, innocent boys for centuries, his vil lage tomb will smell of loyalty as of lilies. 

Millions who never knew him shall love him like a father — this man whom the last few that knew him dealt with like dung. 

He shall be a saint; and the truth shall never be told of him, because I have made up my mind at last. 

There is so much good and evil in breaking secrets, that I put my conduct to a test. 

All these newspapers will perish; the anti Brazil boom is already over; Olivier is already honoured every where. 

But I told myself that if anywhere, by name, in metal or marble that will endure like the pyra mids, Colonel Clancy, or Captain Keith, or Presi dent Olivier, or any innocent man was wrongly blamed, then I would speak. 

If it were only that St. 

Clare was wrongly praised, I would be silent. 

And I will.” 186THE SIGN OF THE BROKEN SWORD They plunged into the red curtained tavern, which was not only cosy, but even luxurious inside. 

On a table stood a silver model of the tomb of St. 

Clare, the silver head bowed, the silver sword bro ken. 

On the walls were coloured photographs of the same scene, and of the system of wagonettes that took tourists to see it. 

They sat down on the com fortable padded benches. 

“Come, it’s cold,” cried Father Brown; “let’s have some wine or beer.” “Or brandy,” said Flambeau.The Paradise of Thieves T HE great Muscari, most original of the young Tuscan poets, walked swiftly into his favour ite restaurant, which overlooked the Mediterranean, was covered by an awning and fenced by little lemon and orange trees. 

Waiters in white aprons were al ready laying out on white tables the insignia of an early and elegant lunch; and this seemed to increase a satisfaction that already touched the top of swag ger. 

Muscari had an eagle nose like Dante; his hair and neckerchief were dark and flowing; he carried a black cloak, and might almost have carried a black mask, so much did he bear with him a sort of Vene tian melodrama. 

He acted as if a troubadour had still a definite social office, like a bishop. 

He went as near as his century permitted to walking the world literally like Don Juan, with rapier and guitar. 

For he never travelled without a case of swords, with which he had fought many brilliant duels, or without a corresponding case for his mandolin, with 188THE PARADISE OF THIEVES which he had actually serenaded Miss Ethel Harro gate, the highly conventional daughter of a York shire banker on a holiday. 

Yet he was neither a char latan nor a child; but a hot, logical Latin who liked a certain thing and was it. 

His poetry was as straight forward as anyone else’s prose. 

He desired fame or wine or the beauty of women with a torrid direct ness inconceivable among the cloudy ideals or cloudy compromises of the north; to vaguer races his intensity smelt of danger or even crime. 

Like fire or the sea, he was too simple to be trusted. 

The banker and his beautiful English daughter were staying at the hotel attached to Muscari’s res taurant; that was why it was his favourite restaurant. 

A glance flashed around the room told him at once, however, that the English party had not descended. 

The restaurant was glittering, but still comparative ly empty. 

Two priests were talking at a table in a corner, but Muscari (an ardent Catholic) took no more notice of them than of a couple of crows. 

But from a yet farther seat, partly concealed behind a dwarf tree golden with oranges, there rose and ad vanced towards the poet a person whose costume was the most aggressively opposite to his own. 

This figure was clad in tweeds of a piebald check, with a pink tie, a sharp collar and protuberant yellow boots. 

He contrived, in the true tradition of ‘Arry at Margate’, to look at once startling and common 189G.

CHESTERTON place. 

But as the Cockney1 apparition drew nearer, Muscari was astounded to observe that the head was distinctly different from the body. 

It was an Italian head: fuzzy, swarthy and very vivacious, that rose abruptly out of the standing collar like cardboard and the comic pink tie. 

In fact it was a head he knew. 

He recognized it, above all the dire erection of English holiday array, as the face of an old but forgotten friend named Ezza. 

This youth had been a prodigy at college, and European fame was promised him when he was barely fifteen; but when he appeared in the world he failed, first publicly as a dramatist and a demagogue, and then privately for years on end as an actor, a traveller, a commission agent or a jour nalist. 

Muscari had known him last behind the foot lights2; he was but too well attuned to the excite ments of that profession, and it was believed that some moral calamity had swallowed him up. 

“Ezza!” cried the poet, rising and shaking hands in a pleasant astonishment. 

“Well, I’ve seen you in many costumes in the green room; but I never ex pected to see you dressed up as an Englishman.” 1 Cockney — диалект, свойственный выходцам из лондонского Ист Энда, характерный опущением в произ ношении буквы h в начале слова 2 had known him last behind the footlights — знавал его еще в те времена, когда тот был актером 190THE PARADISE OF THIEVES “This,” answered Ezza gravely, “is not the costume of an Englishman, but of the Italian of the future.” “In that case,” remarked Muscari, “I confess I prefer the Italian of the past.” “That is your old mistake, Muscari,” said the man in tweeds, shaking his head; “and the mistake of Italy. 

In the sixteenth century we Tuscans made the morning1: we had the newest steel, the newest carving, the newest chemistry. 

Why should we not now have the newest factories, the newest motors, the newest finance — the newest clothes?” “Because they are not worth having,” answered Muscari. 

“You cannot make Italians really progres sive; they are too intelligent. 

Men who see the short cut to good living2 will never go by the new elabo rate roads.” “Well, to me Marconi3, or D’Annunzio4, is the star of Italy?” said the other.

K. 

CHESTERTON “A courier!” cried Muscari, laughing. 

“Is that the last of your list of trades? And whom are you con ducting?” “Oh, a man of the name of Harrogate, and his family, I believe.” “Not the banker in this hotel?” inquired the poet, with some eagerness. 

“That’s the man,” answered the courier. 

“Does it pay well?” asked the troubadour inno cently. 

“It will pay me,” said Ezza, with a very enigmatic smile. 

“But I am a rather curious sort of courier.” Then, as if changing the subject, he said abruptly: “He has a daughter — and a son.” “The daughter is divine,” affirmed Muscari, “the father and son are, I suppose, human. 

But granted his harmless qualities doesn’t that banker strike you as a splendid instance of my argument? Har rogate has millions in his safes, and I have — the hole in my pocket. 

But you daren’t say — you can’t say — that he’s cleverer than I, or bolder than I, or even more energetic. 

He’s not clever, he’s got eyes like blue buttons; he’s not energetic, he moves from chair to chair like a paralytic. 

He’s a conscientious, kindly old blockhead; but he’s got money simply because he collects money, as a boy collects stamps. 

You’re too strong minded for business, Ezza. 

You won’t get on. 

To be clever enough to get all that money, one must be stupid enough to want it.” 192THE PARADISE OF THIEVES “I’m stupid enough for that,” said Ezza gloomily. 

“But I should suggest a suspension of your critique of the banker, for here he comes.” Mr. 

Harrogate, the great financier, did indeed enter the room, but nobody looked at him. 

He was a massive elderly man with a boiled blue eyes and fad ed grey sandy moustaches; but for his heavy stoop he might have been a colonel. 

He carried several un opened letters in his hand. 

His son Frank was a real ly fine lad, curly haired, sun burnt and strenuous; but nobody looked at him either. 

All eyes, as usual, were riveted, for the moment at least, upon Ethel Harrogate, whose golden Greek head and colour of the dawn seemed set purposely above that sapphire sea, like a goddess’s. 

The poet Muscari drew a deep breath as if he were drinking something, as indeed he was. 

He was drinking the Classic; which his fa thers made. 

Ezza studied her with a gaze equally in tense and far more baffling. 

Miss Harrogate was specially radiant and ready for conversation on this occasion; and her family had fallen into the easier Continental habit, allow ing the stranger Muscari and even the courier Ezza to share their table and their talk. 

In Ethel Harro gate conventionality crowned itself with a perfec tion and splendour of its own. 

Proud of her father’s prosperity, fond of fashionable pleasures, a fond daughter but an arrant flirt, she was all these things 193G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON with a sort of golden good nature that made her very pride pleasing and her worldly respectability a fresh and hearty thing. 

They were in an eddy of excitement about some alleged peril in the mountain path they were to at tempt that week. 

The danger was not from rock and avalanche, but from something yet more romantic. 

Ethel had been earnestly assured that brigands, the true cut throats of the modern legend, still haunted that ridge and held that pass of the Apennines. 

“They say,” she cried, with the awful relish of a schoolgirl, “that all that country isn’t ruled by the King of Italy, but by the King of Thieves. 

Who is the King of Thieves?” “A great man,” replied Muscari, “worthy to rank with your own Robin Hood, signorina. 

Montano, the King of Thieves, was first heard of in the moun tains some ten years ago1, when people said brig ands were extinct. 

But his wild authority spread with the swiftness of a silent revolution. 

Men found his fierce proclamations nailed in every mountain village; his sentinels, gun in hand, in every moun tain ravine. 

Six times the Italian Government tried to dislodge him, and was defeated in six pitched bat tles as if by Napoleon.” 1 194 some ten years ago — (разг.) лет десять тому назадTHE PARADISE OF THIEVES “Now that sort of thing,” observed the banker weightily, “would never be allowed in England; per haps, after all, we had better choose another route. 

But the courier thought it perfectly safe.” “It is perfectly safe,” said the courier contemptu ously. 

“I have been over it twenty times. 

There may have been some old jailbird called a King in the time of our grandmothers; but he belongs to history if not to fable. 

Brigandage is utterly stamped out.” “It can never be utterly stamped out,” Muscari answered; “because armed revolt is a recreation nat ural to southerners. 

Our peasants are like their mountains, rich in grace and green gaiety, but with the fires beneath. 

There is a point of human despair where the northern poor take to drink — and our own poor take to daggers.” “A poet is privileged,” replied Ezza, with a sneer. 

“If Signor Muscari were English he would still be looking for highwaymen in Wandsworth. 

Believe me, there is no more danger of being captured in It aly than of being scalped in Boston.” “Then you propose to attempt it?” asked Mr. 

Harrogate, frowning. 

“Oh, it sounds rather dreadful,” cried the girl, turning her glorious eyes on Muscari. 

“Do you real ly think the pass is dangerous?” Muscari threw back his black mane. 

“I know it is dangerous,” he said. 

“I am crossing it tomorrow.” 195G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON The young Harrogate was left behind for a mo ment emptying a glass of white wine and lighting a cigarette, as the beauty retired with the banker, the courier and the poet, distributing peals of silvery satire. 

At about the same instant the two priests in the corner rose; the taller, a white haired Italian, taking his leave. 

The shorter priest turned and walked towards the banker’s son, and the latter was astonished to realize that though a Roman priest the man was an Englishman. 

He vaguely remembered meeting him at the social crushes of some of his Catholic friends. 

But the man spoke before his memories could collect themselves. 

“Mr. 

Frank Harrogate, I think,” he said. 

“I have had an introduction, but I do not mean to presume on it. 

The odd thing I have to say will come far bet ter from a stranger. 

Mr. 

Harrogate, I say one word and go: take care of your sister in her great sorrow.” Even for Frank’s truly fraternal indifference the radiance and derision of his sister still seemed to sparkle and ring; he could hear her laughter still from the garden of the hotel, and he stared at his sombre adviser in puzzledom. 

“Do you mean the brigands?” he asked; and then, remembering a vague fear of his own, “or can you be thinking of Muscari?” “One is never thinking of the real sorrow,” said the strange priest. 

“One can only be kind when it comes.” 196A day or two afterwards a coach containing the company was really crawling and staggering up the spurs of the menacing mountain range. 

Between Ez za’s cheery denial of the danger and Muscari’s bois terous defiance of it, the financial family were firm in their original purpose; and Muscari made his mountain journey coincide with theirs. 

A more sur prising feature was the appearance at the coast town station of the little priest of the restaurant; he alleged merely that business led him also to cross the mountains of the midland. 

But young Harrogate could not but connect his presence with the mysti cal fears and warnings of yesterday. 

The coach was a kind of commodious wagonette, invented by the modernist talent of the courier, who dominated the expedition with his scientific activity and breezy wit. 

The theory of danger from thieves was banished from thought and speech; though so far conceded in formal act that some slight protec tion was employed. 

The courier and the young banker carried loaded revolvers, and Muscari (with much boyish gratification) buckled on a kind of cutlass under his black cloak. 

He had planted his person at a flying leap next to the lovely Englishwoman; on the other side of her THE PARADISE OF THIEVES And he passed promptly from the room, leaving the other almost with his mouth open. 

197G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON sat the priest, whose name was Brown and who was fortunately a silent individual; the courier and the father and son were on the bank behind. 

Muscari was in towering spirits1, seriously believing in the peril, and his talk to Ethel might well have made her think him a maniac. 

But there was something in the crazy and gorgeous ascent, amid crags like peaks loaded with woods like orchards, that dragged her spirit up along with his into purple preposterous heavens with wheeling suns. 

The white road climbed like a white cat; it spanned sunless chasms like a tight rope; it was flung round far off head lands like a lasso. 

And yet, however high they went, the desert still blossomed like the rose. 

The fields were burnished in sun and wind with the colour of kingfisher and parrot and humming bird, the hues of a hundred flowering flowers. 

There are no lovelier meadows and woodlands than the English, no nobler crests or chasms than those of Snowdon and Glencoe. 

But Ethel Harrogate had never before seen the southern parks tilted on the splintered northern peaks; the gorge of Glencoe laden with the fruits of Kent. 

There was nothing here of that chill and desolation that in Britain one associates with high and wild 1 нии 198 in towering spirits — (разг.) в превосходном настроеTHE PARADISE OF THIEVES scenery. 

It was rather like a mosaic palace, rent with earthquakes; or like a Dutch tulip garden blown to the stars with dynamite. 

“It’s like Kew Gardens on Beachy Head,” said Ethel. 

“It is our secret,” answered he, “the secret of the volcano; that is also the secret of the revolution — that a thing can be violent and yet fruitful.” “You are rather violent yourself,” and she smiled at him. 

“And yet rather fruitless,” he admitted; “if I die tonight I die unmarried and a fool.” “It is not my fault if you have come,” she said af ter a difficult silence. 

“It is never your fault,” answered Muscari; “it was not your fault that Troy1 fell.” As they spoke they came under overwhelming cliffs that spread almost like wings above a corner of peculiar peril. 

Shocked by the big shadow on the narrow ledge, the horses stirred doubtfully. 

The driver leapt to the earth to hold their heads, and they became ungovernable. 

One horse reared up to his full height — the titanic and terrifying height of a horse when he becomes a biped2. 

It was just 1 Troy — Троя (Илион) — древний город на северо западе Малой Азии, разрушена в ходе войны троянцев с ахейцами 2 becomes a biped— (разг.) встает на дыбы 199G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON enough to alter the equilibrium; the whole coach heeled over like a ship and crashed through the fringe of bushes over the cliff. 

Muscari threw an arm round Ethel, who clung to him, and shouted aloud. 

It was for such moments that he lived. 

At the moment when the gorgeous mountain walls went round the poet’s head like a purple wind mill a thing happened which was superficially even more startling. 

The elderly and lethargic banker sprang erect in the coach and leapt over the preci pice before the tilted vehicle could take him there. 

In the first flash it looked as wild as suicide; but in the second it was as sensible as a safe investment. 

The Yorkshireman had evidently more promptitude, as well as more sagacity, than Muscari had given him credit for; for he landed in a lap of land which might have been specially padded with turf and clo ver to receive him. 

As it happened, indeed, the whole company were equally lucky, if less dignified in their form of ejection. 

Immediately under this abrupt turn of the road was a grassy and flowery hollow like a sunken meadow; a sort of green velvet pocket in the long, green, trailing garments of the hills. 

Into this they were all tipped or tumbled with little damage1, save that their smallest baggage and 1 with little damage — (разг.) почти невредимыми, вот разве что 200THE PARADISE OF THIEVES even the contents of their pockets were scattered in the grass around them. 

The wrecked coach still hung above, entangled in the tough hedge, and the horses plunged painfully down the slope. 

The first to sit up was the little priest, who scratched his head with a face of foolish wonder. 

Frank Harrogate heard him say to himself: “Now why on earth have we fallen just here?” He blinked at the litter around him, and recov ered his own very clumsy umbrella. 

Beyond it lay the broad sombrero fallen from the head of Mus cari, and beside it a sealed business letter which, af ter a glance at the address, he returned to the elder Harrogate. 

On the other side of him the grass partly hid Miss Ethel’s sunshade, and just beyond it lay a curious little glass bottle hardly two inches long. 

The priest picked it up; in a quick, unobtrusive manner he uncorked and sniffed it, and his heavy face turned the colour of clay. 

“Heaven deliver us!” he muttered; “it can’t be hers! Has her sorrow come on her already?” He slipped it into his own waistcoat pocket. 

“I think I’m justified,” he said, “till I know a little more.” He gazed painfully at the girl, at that moment being raised out of the flowers by Muscari, who was saying: “We have fallen into heaven; it is a sign. 

Mortals climb up and they fall down; but it is only gods and goddesses who can fall upwards.” 201G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON And indeed she rose out of the sea of colours so beautiful and happy a vision that the priest felt his suspicion shaken and shifted. 

“After all,” he thought, “perhaps the poison isn’t hers; perhaps it’s one of Muscari’s melodramatic tricks.” Muscari set the lady lightly on her feet, made her an absurdly theatrical bow, and then, drawing his cut lass, hacked hard at the taut reins of the horses, so that they scrambled to their feet and stood in the grass trembling. 

When he had done so, a most remarkable thing occurred. 

A very quiet man, very poorly dressed and extremely sunburnt, came out of the bushes and took hold of the horses’ heads. 

He had a queer shaped knife, very broad and crooked, buckled on his belt; there was nothing else remarkable about him, except his sudden and silent appearance. 

The poet asked him who he was, and he did not answer. 

Looking around him at the confused and startled group in the hollow, Muscari then perceived that another tanned and tattered man, with a short gun under his arm, was looking at them from the ledge just below, leaning his elbows on the edge of the turf. 

Then he looked up at the road from which they had fallen and saw, looking down on them, the muz zles of four other carbines and four other brown faces with bright but quite motionless eyes. 

“The brigands!” cried Muscari, with a kind of monstrous gaiety. 

“This was a trap. 

Ezza, if you will 202THE PARADISE OF THIEVES oblige me by shooting the coachman first, we can cut our way out yet. 

There are only six of them.” “The coachman,” said Ezza, who was standing grimly with his hands in his pockets, “happens to be a servant of Mr. 

Harrogate’s.” “Then shoot him all the more,” cried the poet im patiently; “he was bribed to upset his master. 

Then put the lady in the middle, and we will break the line up there — with a rush.” And, wading in wild grass and flowers, he ad vanced fearlessly on the four carbines; but finding that no one followed except young Harrogate, he turned, brandishing his cutlass to wave the others on. 

He beheld the courier still standing slightly astride in the centre of the grassy ring, his hands in his pockets; and his lean, ironical Italian face seemed to grow longer and longer in the evening light. 

“You thought, Muscari, I was the failure among our schoolfellows,” he said, “and you thought you were the success. 

But I have succeeded more than you and fill a bigger place in history. 

I have been acting epics while you have been writing them.” “Come on, I tell you!” thundered Muscari from above. 

“Will you stand there talking nonsense about yourself with a woman to save and three strong men to help you? What do you call yourself?” “I call myself Montano,” cried the strange couri er in a voice equally loud and full. 

“I am the King of 203G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON Thieves, and I welcome you all to my summer palace.” And even as he spoke five more silent men with weapons ready came out of the bushes, and looked towards him for their orders. 

One of them held a large paper in his hand. 

“This pretty little nest where we are all picnick ing,” went on the courier brigand, with the same easy yet sinister smile, “is, together with some caves underneath it, known by the name of the Paradise of Thieves. 

It is my principal stronghold on these hills; for (as you have doubtless noticed) the eyrie is invisible both from the road above and from the val ley below. 

It is something better than impregnable; it is unnoticeable. 

Here I mostly live, and here I shall certainly die, if the gendarmes ever track me here. 

I am not the kind of criminal that ‘reserves his defence,’ but the better kind that reserves his last bullet.” All were staring at him thunderstruck and still, except Father Brown, who heaved a huge sigh as of relief and fingered the little phial in his pocket. 

“Thank God!” he muttered; “that’s much more probable. 

The poison belongs to this robber chief, of course. 

He carries it so that he may never be cap tured, like Cato.” The King of Thieves was, however, continuing his address with the same kind of dangerous polite 204THE PARADISE OF THIEVES ness. 

“It only remains for me,” he said, “to explain to my guests the social conditions upon which I have the pleasure of entertaining them. 

I need not ex pound the quaint old ritual of ransom, which it is incumbent upon me to keep up; and even this only applies to a part of the company. 

The Reverend Fa ther Brown and the celebrated Signor Muscari I shall release tomorrow at dawn and escort to my outposts. 

Poets and priests, if you will pardon my simplicity of speech, never have any money. 

And so (since it is impossible to get anything out of them), let us seize the opportunity to show our admiration for classic literature and our reverence for Holy Church.” He paused with an unpleasing smile; and Father Brown blinked repeatedly at him, and seemed sud denly to be listening with great attention. 

The brig and captain took the large paper from the attendant brigand and, glancing over it, continued: “My other intentions are clearly set forth in this public docu ment, which I will hand round in a moment; and which after that will be posted on a tree by every vil lage in the valley, and every cross road in the hills. 

I will not weary you with the verbalism, since you will be able to check it; the substance of my proclama tion is this: I announce first that I have captured the English millionaire, the colossus of finance, Mr. 

Samuel Harrogate. 

I next announce that I have 205G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON found on his person notes and bonds for two thou sand pounds, which he has given up to me. 

Now since it would be really immoral to announce such a thing to a credulous public if it had not occurred, I suggest it should occur without further delay. 

I sug gest that Mr. 

Harrogate senior should now give me the two thousand pounds in his pocket.” The banker looked at him under lowering brows, red faced and sulky, but seemingly cowed. 

That leap from the failing carriage seemed to have used up his last virility. 

He had held back in a hang dog style1 when his son and Muscari had made a bold move ment to break out of the brigand trap. 

And now his red and trembling hand went reluctantly to his breast pocket, and passed a bundle of papers and envelopes to the brigand. 

“Excellent!” cried that outlaw gaily; “so far we are all cosy. 

I resume the points of my proclamation, so soon to be published to all Italy. 

The third item is that of ransom. 

I am asking from the friends of the Harrogate family a ransom of three thousand pounds, which I am sure is almost insulting to that family in its moderate estimate of their importance. 

Who would not pay triple this sum for another day’s association with such a domestic circle? I will not 1 hangdog style — (разг.) пристыженно; с видом по битой собаки 206THE PARADISE OF THIEVES conceal from you that the document ends with cer tain legal phrases about the unpleasant things that may happen if the money is not paid; but mean while, ladies and gentlemen, let me assure you that I am comfortably off here for accommodation, wine and cigars, and bid you for the present a sportsman like welcome to the luxuries of the Paradise of Thieves.” All the time that he had been speaking, the dubi ous looking men with carbines and dirty slouch hats had been gathering silently in such preponder ating numbers that even Muscari was compelled to recognize his sally with the sword as hopeless. 

He glanced around him; but the girl had already gone over to soothe and comfort her father, for her natu ral affection for his person was as strong or stronger than her somewhat snobbish pride in his success. 

Muscari, with the illogicality of a lover, admired this filial devotion, and yet was irritated by it. 

He slapped his sword back in the scabbard and went and flung himself somewhat sulkily on one of the green banks. 

The priest sat down within a yard or two, and Muscari turned his aquiline nose on him in an instantaneous irritation. 

“Well,” said the poet tartly, “do people still think me too romantic? Are there, I wonder, any brigands left in the mountains?” “There may be,” said Father Brown agnostically. 

207G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON “What do you mean?” asked the other sharply. 

“I mean I am puzzled,” replied the priest. 

“I am puzzled about Ezza or Montano, or whatever his name is. 

He seems to me much more inexplicable as a brigand even than he was as a courier.” “But in what way?” persisted his companion. 

“Santa Maria! I should have thought the brigand was plain enough.” “I find three curious difficulties,” said the priest in a quiet voice. 

“I should like to have your opinion on them. 

First of all I must tell you I was lunching in that restaurant at the seaside. 

As four of you left the room, you and Miss Harrogate went ahead, talking and laughing; the banker and the courier came be hind, speaking sparely and rather low. 

But I could not help hearing Ezza say these words — ‘Well, let her have a little fun; you know the blow may smash her any minute.’ Mr. 

Harrogate answered nothing; so the words must have had some meaning. 

On the impulse of the moment I warned her brother that she might be in peril; I said nothing of its nature, for I did not know. 

But if it meant this capture in the hills, the thing is nonsense. 

Why should the brig and courier warn his patron, even by a hint, when it was his whole purpose to lure him into the moun tain mousetrap? It could not have meant that. 

But if not, what is this disaster, known both to courier and banker, which hangs over Miss Harrogate’s head?” 208THE PARADISE OF THIEVES “Disaster to Miss Harrogate!” ejaculated the poet, sitting up with some ferocity. 

“Explain your self; go on.” “All my riddles, however, revolve round our ban dit chief,” resumed the priest reflectively. 

“And here is the second of them. 

Why did he put so promi nently in his demand for ransom the fact that he had taken two thousand pounds from his victim on the spot? It had no faintest tendency to evoke the ransom. 

Quite the other way, in fact. 

Harrogate’s friends would be far likelier to fear for his fate if they thought the thieves were poor and desperate. 

Yet the spoliation on the spot was emphasized and even put first in the demand. 

Why should Ezza Montano want so specially to tell all Europe that he had picked the pocket1 before he levied the blackmail?” “I cannot imagine,” said Muscari, rubbing up his black hair for once with an unaffected gesture. 

“You may think you enlighten me, but you are leading me deeper in the dark. 

What may be the third objection to the King of the Thieves?” “The third objection,” said Father Brown, still in meditation, “is this bank we are sitting on. 

Why does our brigand courier call this his chief fortress and the Paradise of Thieves? It is certainly a soft 1 had picked the pocket— (зд.) был карманным во ришкой 209G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON spot to fall on and a sweet spot to look at. 

It is also quite true, as he says, that it is invisible from valley and peak, and is therefore a hiding place. 

But it is not a fortress. 

It never could be a fortress. 

I think it would be the worst fortress in the world. 

For it is ac tually commanded from above by the common high road across the mountains — the very place where the police would most probably pass. 

Why, five shabby short guns held us helpless here about half an hour ago. 

The quarter of a company of any kind of soldiers could have blown us over the preci pice. 

Whatever is the meaning of this odd little nook of grass and flowers, it is not an entrenched posi tion. 

It is something else; it has some other strange sort of importance; some value that I do not under stand. 

It is more like an accidental theatre or a natu ral green room; it is like the scene for some roman tic comedy; it is like . 

. 

.” As the little priest’s words lengthened and lost themselves in a dull and dreamy sincerity, Muscari, whose animal senses were alert and impatient, heard a new noise in the mountains. 

Even for him the sound was as yet very small and faint; but he could have sworn the evening breeze bore with it something like the pulsation of horses’ hoofs and a distant hallooing. 

At the same moment, and long before the vibra tion had touched the less experienced English ears, 210THE PARADISE OF THIEVES Montano the brigand ran up the bank above them and stood in the broken hedge, steadying himself against a tree and peering down the road. 

He was a strange figure as he stood there, for he had assumed a flapped fantastic hat and swinging baldric and cutlass in his capacity of bandit king, but the bright prosaic tweed of the courier showed through in patches all over him. 

The next moment he turned his olive, sneering face and made a movement with his hand. 

The brig ands scattered at the signal, not in confusion, but in what was evidently a kind of guerrilla discipline. 

In stead of occupying the road along the ridge, they sprinkled themselves along the side of it behind the trees and the hedge, as if watching unseen for an enemy. 

The noise beyond grew stronger, beginning to shake the mountain road, and a voice could be clearly heard calling out orders. 

The brigands swayed and huddled, cursing and whispering, and the evening air was full of little metallic noises as they cocked their pistols, or loosened their knives, or trailed their scabbards over the stones. 

Then the noises from both quarters seemed to meet on the road above; branches broke, horses neighed, men cried out. 

“A rescue!” cried Muscari, springing to his feet and waving his hat; “the gendarmes are on them! Now for freedom and a blow for it! Now to be rebels 211G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON against robbers! Come, don’t let us leave everything to the police; that is so dreadfully modern. 

Fall on the rear of these ruffians. 

The gendarmes are rescu ing us; come, friends, let us rescue the gendarmes!” And throwing his hat over the trees, he drew his cutlass once more and began to escalade the slope up to the road. 

Frank Harrogate jumped up and ran across to help him, revolver in hand, but was as tounded to hear himself imperatively recalled by the raucous voice of his father, who seemed to be in great agitation. 

“I won’t have it,” said the banker in a choking voice; “I command you not to interfere.” “But, father,” said Frank very warmly, “an Italian gentleman has led the way. 

You wouldn’t have it said that the English hung back.” “It is useless,” said the older man, who was trem bling violently, “it is useless. 

We must submit to our lot.1” Father Brown looked at the banker; then he put his hand instinctively as if on his heart, but really on the little bottle of poison; and a great light came into his face like the light of the revelation of death. 

Muscari meanwhile, without waiting for sup port, had crested the bank up to the road, and 1 We must submit to our lot. 

— Мы должны покорить ся судьбе. 

212THE PARADISE OF THIEVES struck the brigand king heavily on the shoulder, causing him to stagger and swing round. 

Montano also had his cutlass unsheathed, and Muscari, with out further speech, sent a slash at his head which he was compelled to catch and parry. 

But even as the two short blades crossed and clashed the King of Thieves deliberately dropped his point and laughed. 

“What’s the good, old man?” he said in spirited Italian slang; “this damned farce will soon be over.” “What do you mean, you shuffler?” panted the fire eating poet. 

“Is your courage a sham as well as your honesty?” “Everything about me is a sham,” responded the ex courier in complete good humour. 

“I am an ac tor; and if I ever had a private character, I have for gotten it. 

I am no more a genuine brigand than I am a genuine courier. 

I am only a bundle of masks, and you can’t fight a duel with that.” And he laughed with boyish pleasure and fell into his old straddling attitude, with his back to the skirmish up the road. 

Darkness was deepening under the mountain walls, and it was not easy to discern much of the progress of the struggle, save that tall men were pushing their horses’ muzzles through a clinging crowd of brigands, who seemed more inclined to harass and hustle the invaders than to kill them. 

It was more like a town crowd preventing the passage of the police than anything the poet had ever pic 213G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON tured as the last stand of doomed and outlawed men of blood. 

Just as he was rolling his eyes in bewilder ment he felt a touch on his elbow, and found the odd little priest standing there like a small Noah1 with a large hat, and requesting the favour of a word or two. 

“Signor Muscari,” said the cleric, “in this queer crisis personalities may be pardoned2. 

I may tell you without offence of a way in which you will do more good than by helping the gendarmes, who are bound to break through in any case. 

You will permit me the impertinent intimacy, but do you care about that girl? Care enough to marry her and make her a good husband, I mean?” “Yes,” said the poet quite simply. 

“Does she care about you?” “I think so,” was the equally grave reply. 

“Then go over there and offer yourself,” said the priest, “offer her everything you can; offer her heav en and earth if you’ve got them. 

The time is short.” “Why?” asked the astonished man of letters. 

“Because,” said Father Brown, “her Doom is coming up the road.” 1 Noah — Ной, в библейской мифологии праведник, спасшийся на ковчеге во время всемирного потопа 2 personalities may be pardoned — можно отбросить церемонии 214THE PARADISE OF THIEVES “Nothing is coming up the road,” argued Mus cari, “except the rescue.” “Well, you go over there,” said his adviser, “and be ready to rescue her from the rescue.” Almost as he spoke the hedges were broken all along the ridge by a rush of the escaping brigands. 

They dived into bushes and thick grass like defeated men pursued; and the great cocked hats of the mounted gendarmerie were seen passing along above the broken hedge. 

Another order was given; there was a noise of dismounting, and a tall officer with cocked hat, a grey imperial, and a paper in his hand appeared in the gap that was the gate of the Paradise of Thieves. 

There was a momentary si lence, broken in an extraordinary way by the bank er, who cried out in a hoarse and strangled voice: “Robbed! I’ve been robbed!” “Why, that was hours ago,” cried his son in as tonishment, “when you were robbed of two thou sand pounds.” “Not of two thousand pounds,” said the finan cier, with an abrupt and terrible composure, “only of a small bottle.” The policeman with the grey imperial was strid ing across the green hollow. 

Encountering the King of the Thieves in his path, he clapped him on the shoulder with something between a caress and a buffet and gave him a push that sent him staggering 215G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON away. 

“You’ll get into trouble, too,” he said, “if you play these tricks.” Again to Muscari’s artistic eye it seemed scarcely like the capture of a great outlaw at bay1. 

Passing on, the policeman halted before the Harrogate group and said: “Samuel Harrogate, I arrest you in the name of the law for embezzlement of the funds of the Hull and Huddersfield Bank.” The great banker nodded with an odd air of busi ness assent, seemed to reflect a moment, and before they could interpose took a half turn and a step that brought him to the edge of the outer mountain wall. 

Then, flinging up his hands, he leapt exactly as he leapt out of the coach. 

But this time he did not fall into a little meadow just beneath; he fell a thousand feet below, to become a wreck of bones in the valley. 

The anger of the Italian policeman, which he ex pressed volubly to Father Brown, was largely mixed with admiration. 

“It was like him to escape us at last,” he said. 

“He was a great brigand if you like. 

This last trick of his I believe to be absolutely un precedented. 

He fled with the company’s money to Italy, and actually got himself captured by sham brigands in his own pay, so as to explain both the disappearance of the money and the disappearance of himself. 

That demand for ransom was really tak 1 216 at bay — (зд.) в безвыходном положенииTHE PARADISE OF THIEVES en seriously by most of the police. 

But for years he’s been doing things as good as that, quite as good as that. 

He will be a serious loss to his family.” Muscari was leading away the unhappy daugh ter, who held hard to him, as she did for many a year after. 

But even in that tragic wreck he could not help having a smile and a hand of half mocking friendship for the indefensible Ezza Montano. 

“And where are you going next?” he asked him over his shoulder. 

“Birmingham,” answered the actor, puffing a cig arette. 

“Didn’t I tell you I was a Futurist? I really do believe in those things if I believe in anything. 

Change, bustle and new things every morning. 

I am going to Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Hull, Hud dersfield, Glasgow, Chicago — in short, to enlight ened, energetic, civilized society!” “In short,” said Muscari, “to the real Paradise of Thieves.”The Mistake of the Machine F and his friend the priest were sit ting in the Temple Gardens about sunset; and their neighbourhood or some such accidental influ ence had turned their talk to matters of legal proc ess. 

From the problem of the licence in cross exami nation, their talk strayed to Roman and mediaeval torture, to the examining magistrate in France and the Third Degree1 in America. 

“I’ve been reading,” said Flambeau, “of this new psychometric method they talk about so much, es pecially in America. 

You know what I mean; they put a pulsometer on a man’s wrist and judge by how his heart goes at the pronunciation of certain words. 

What do you think of it?” “I think it very interesting,” replied Father Brown; “it reminds me of that interesting idea in the Dark Ages that blood would flow from a corpse if the murderer touched it.” LAMBEAU 1 the Third Degree — Третья степень — допрос с при менением пыток 218THE MISTAKE OF THE MACHINE “Do you really mean,” demanded his friend, “that you think the two methods equally valuable?” “I think them equally valueless,” replied Brown. 

“Blood flows, fast or slow, in dead folk or living, for so many more million reasons than we can ever know. 

Blood will have to flow very funnily; blood will have to flow up the Matterhorn1, before I will take it as a sign that I am to shed it.” “The method,” remarked the other, “has been guaranteed by some of the greatest American men of science.” “What sentimentalists men of science are!” ex claimed Father Brown, “and how much more senti mental must American men of science be! Who but a Yankee would think of proving anything from heart throbs? Why, they must be as sentimental as a man who thinks a woman is in love with him if she blushes. 

That’s a test from the circulation of the blood, discovered by the immortal Harvey; and a jolly rotten test, too.” “But surely,” insisted Flambeau, “it might point pretty straight at something or other.” “There’s a disadvantage in a stick pointing straight,” answered the other. 

“What is it? Why, the other end of the stick always points the opposite 1 Matterhorn — Маттерхорн — гора на границе Швей царии и Италии 219G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON way. 

It depends whether you get hold of the stick by the right end. 

I saw the thing done once and I’ve never believed in it since.” And he proceeded to tell the story of his disillusionment. 

It happened nearly twenty years before, when he was a chaplain to his co religionists in a prison in Chicago — where the Irish population displayed a capacity both for crime and penitence which kept him tolerably busy. 

The official second in com mand under the Governor was an ex detective named Greywood Usher, a cadaverous, careful spo ken Yankee philosopher, occasionally varying a very rigid visage with an odd apologetic grimace. 

He liked Father Brown in a slightly patronizing way; and Father Brown liked him, though he heartily dis liked his theories. 

His theories were extremely com plicated and were held with extreme simplicity. 

One evening he had sent for the priest, who, ac cording to his custom, took a seat in silence at a ta ble piled and littered with papers, and waited. 

The official selected from the papers a scrap of newspa per cutting, which he handed across to the cleric, who read it gravely. 

It appeared to be an extract from one of the pinkest of American Society papers, and ran as follows: “Society’s brightest widower is once more on the Freak Dinner stunt. 

All our exclusive citizens will recall the Perambulator Parade Dinner, in which 220THE MISTAKE OF THE MACHINE Last Trick Todd, at his palatial home at Pilgrim’s Pond, caused so many of our prominent debutantes to look even younger than their years. 

Equally ele gant and more miscellaneous and large hearted in social outlook was Last Trick’s show the year previ ous, the popular Cannibal Crush Lunch, at which the confections handed round were sarcastically moulded in the forms of human arms and legs, and during which more than one of our gayest mental gymnasts was heard offering to eat his partner. 

The witticism which will inspire this evening is as yet in Mr. 

Todd’s pretty reticent intellect, or locked in the jewelled bosoms of our city’s gayest leaders; but there is talk of a pretty parody of the simple man ners and customs at the other end of Society’s scale. 

This would be all the more telling, as hospitable Todd is entertaining in Lord Falconroy, the famous traveller, a true blooded aristocrat fresh from Eng land’s oak groves. 

Lord Falconroy’s travels began before his ancient feudal title was resurrected, he was in the Republic in his youth, and fashion mur murs a sly reason for his return.

“I cannot think at this moment of anything 221G.

And, un less the just anger of the Republic is at last going to electrocute journalists for writing like that, I don’t quite see why it should interest you either.” “Ah!” said Mr. 

Usher dryly, and handing across another scrap of newspaper. 

“Well, does that inter est you?” The paragraph was headed “Savage Murder of a Warder. 

Convict Escapes,” and ran: “Just before dawn this morning a shout for help was heard in the Convict Settlement at Sequah in this State. 

The autho rities, hurrying in the direction of the cry, found the corpse of the warder who patrols the top of the north wall of the prison, the steepest and most diffi cult exit, for which one man has always been found sufficient. 

The unfortunate officer had, however, been hurled from the high wall, his brains beaten out as with a club, and his gun was missing. 

Further inquiries showed that one of the cells was empty; it had been occupied by a rather sullen ruffian giving his name as Oscar Rian. 

He was only temporarily detained for some comparatively trivial assault; but he gave everyone the impression of a man with a black past and a dangerous future. 

Finally, when daylight had fully revealed the scene of murder, it was found that he had written on the wall above the body a fragmentary sentence, apparently with a fin ger dipped in blood: ‘This was self defence and he 2221 2 THE MISTAKE OF THE MACHINE had the gun. 

I meant no harm to him or any man but one. 

I am keeping the bullet for Pilgrim’s Pond — O.R.’ A man must have used most fiendish treachery or most savage and amazing bodily daring to have stormed such a wall in spite of an armed man.” “Well, the literary style is somewhat improved,” admitted the priest cheerfully, “but still I don’t see what I can do for you. 

I should cut a poor figure1, with my short legs, running about this State after an athletic assassin of that sort. 

I doubt whether any body could find him. 

The convict settlement at Se quah is thirty miles from here; the country between is wild and tangled enough, and the country be yond, where he will surely have the sense to go, is a perfect no man’s land2 tumbling away to the prai ries. 

He may be in any hole or up any tree.” “He isn’t in any hole,” said the governor; “he isn’t up any tree.” “Why, how do you know?” asked Father Brown, blinking. 

“Would you like to speak to him?” inquired Usher. 

Father Brown opened his innocent eyes wide. 

“He is here?” he exclaimed. 

“Why, how did your men get hold of him?” I should cut a poor figure — я буду смешно выглядеть noman’s land — пустошь 223G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON “I got hold of him myself,” drawled the Ameri can, rising and lazily stretching his lanky legs before the fire. 

“I got hold of him with the crooked end of a walking stick. 

Don’t look so surprised. 

I really did. 

You know I sometimes take a turn in the country lanes outside this dismal place; well, I was walking early this evening up a steep lane with dark hedges and grey looking ploughed fields on both sides; and a young moon was up and silvering the road. 

By the light of it I saw a man running across the field to wards the road; running with his body bent and at a good mile race trot. 

He appeared to be much ex hausted; but when he came to the thick black hedge he went through it as if it were made of spiders’ webs; r rather (for I heard the strong branches breaking and snapping like bayonets) as if he him self were made of stone. 

In the instant in which he appeared up against the moon, crossing the road, I slung my hooked cane at his legs, tripping him and bringing him down. 

Then I blew my whistle long and loud, and our fellows came running up to se cure him.” “It would have been rather awkward,” remarked Brown, “if you had found he was a popular athlete practising a mile race.” “He was not,” said Usher grimly. 

“We soon found out who he was; but I had guessed it with the first glint of the moon on him.” 224THE MISTAKE OF THE MACHINE “You thought it was the runaway convict,” ob served the priest simply, “because you had read in the newspaper cutting that morning that a convict had run away.” “I had somewhat better grounds1,” replied the governor coolly. 

“I pass over the first as too simple to be emphasized — I mean that fashionable athletes do not run across ploughed fields or scratch their eyes out in bramble hedges. 

Nor do they run all doubled up like a crouching dog. 

There were more decisive details to a fairly well trained eye. 

The man was clad in coarse and ragged clothes, but they were some thing more than merely coarse and ragged. 

They were so ill fitting as to be quite grotesque; even as he appeared in black outline against the moonrise, the coat collar in which his head was buried made him look like a hunchback, and the long loose sleeves looked as if he had no hands. 

It at once occurred to me that he had somehow managed to change his convict clothes for some confederate’s clothes which did not fit him. 

Second, there was a pretty stiff wind against which he was running; so that I must have seen the streaky look of blowing hair, if the hair had not been very short. 

Then I remembered that beyond these ploughed fields he was crossing lay Pilgrim’s 1 I had somewhat better grounds — (разг.) У меня были более веские основания 225G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON Pond, for which (you will remember) the convict was keeping his bullet; and I sent my walking stick flying.” “A brilliant piece of rapid deduction,” said Father Brown; “but had he got a gun?” As Usher stopped abruptly in his walk the priest added apologetically: “I’ve been told a bullet is not half so useful without it.” “He had no gun,” said the other gravely; “but that was doubtless due to some very natural mis chance or change of plans. 

Probably the same policy that made him change the clothes made him drop the gun; he began to repent the coat he had left be hind him in the blood of his victim.” “Well, that is possible enough,” answered the priest. 

“And it’s hardly worth speculating on,” said Ush er, turning to some other papers, “for we know it’s the man by this time.” His clerical friend asked faintly: “But how?” And Greywood Usher threw down the newspapers and took up the two press cuttings again. 

“Well, since you are so obstinate,” he said, “let’s begin at the beginning. 

You will notice that these two cuttings have only one thing in common, which is the mention of Pilgrim’s Pond, the estate, as you know, of the millionaire Ireton Todd. 

You also know that he is a remarkable character; one of those that rose on stepping stones — ” 2261 THE MISTAKE OF THE MACHINE “Of our dead selves to higher things,” assented his companion. 

“Yes; I know that. 

Petroleum, I think.” “Anyhow,” said Usher, “Last Trick Todd counts for a great deal in this rum affair.” He stretched himself once more before the fire and continued talking in his expansive, radiantly explanatory style. 

“To begin with, on the face of it1, there is no mys tery here at all. 

It is not mysterious, it is not even odd, that a jailbird should take his gun to Pilgrim’s Pond. 

Our people aren’t like the English, who will forgive a man for being rich if he throws away money on hospitals or horses. 

Last Trick Todd has made himself big by his own considerable abilities; and there’s no doubt that many of those on whom he has shown his abilities would like to show theirs on him with a shot gun. 

Todd might easily get dropped by some man he’d never even heard of; some labourer he’d locked out, or some clerk in a business he’d busted. 

Last Trick is a man of mental endowments and a high public character; but in this country the relations of employers and employed are considerably strained. 

That’s how the whole thing looks supposing this Rian made for Pilgrim’s Pond to kill Todd. 

So it on the face of it — если приглядеться 227G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON looked to me, till another little discovery woke up what I have of the detective in me. 

When I had my prisoner safe, I picked up my cane again and strolled down the two or three turns of country road that brought me to one of the side entrances of Todd’s grounds, the one nearest to the pool or lake after which the place is named. 

It was some two hours ago, about seven by this time; the moonlight was more luminous, and I could see the long white streaks of it lying on the mysterious mere with its grey, greasy, half liquid shores in which they say our fathers used to make witches walk until they sank. 

I’d forgotten the exact tale; but you know the place I mean; it lies north of Todd’s house towards the wilderness, and has two queer wrinkled trees, so dismal that they look more like huge fungoids than decent foliage. 

As I stood peering at this misty pool, I fancied I saw the faint figure of a man moving from the house towards it, but it was all too dim and distant for one to be certain of the fact, and still less of the details. 

Besides, my attention was very sharply arrested by something much closer. 

I crouched be hind the fence which ran not more than two hun dred yards from one wing of the great mansion, and which was fortunately split in places, as if specially for the application of a cautious eye. 

A door had opened in the dark bulk of the left wing, and a figure appeared black against the illuminated interior — 228THE MISTAKE OF THE MACHINE a muffled figure bending forward, evidently peering out into the night. 

It closed the door behind it, and I saw it was carrying a lantern, which threw a patch of imperfect light on the dress and figure of the wearer. 

It seemed to be the figure of a woman, wrapped up in a ragged cloak and evidently dis guised to avoid notice; there was something very strange both about the rags and the furtiveness in a person coming out of those rooms lined with gold. 

She took cautiously the curved garden path which brought her within half a hundred yards of me — then she stood up for an instant on the terrace of turf that looks towards the slimy lake, and holding her flaming lantern above her head she deliberately swung it three times to and fro as for a signal. 

As she swung it the second time a flicker of its light fell for a moment on her own face, a face that I knew. 

She was unnaturally pale, and her head was bundled in her borrowed plebeian shawl; but I am certain it was Etta Todd, the millionaire’s daughter. 

She retraced her steps in equal secrecy and the door closed behind her again. 

I was about to climb the fence and follow, when I realized that the detec tive fever that had lured me into the adventure was rather undignified; and that in a more authoritative capacity I already held all the cards in my hand. 

I was just turning away when a new noise broke on the night. 

A window was thrown up in one of the 229G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON upper floors, but just round the corner of the house so that I could not see it; and a voice of terrible dis tinctness was heard shouting across the dark garden to know where Lord Falconroy was, for he was missing from every room in the house. 

There was no mistaking that voice. 

I have heard it on many a po litical platform or meeting of directors; it was Ireton Todd himself. 

Some of the others seemed to have gone to the lower windows or on to the steps, and were calling up to him that Falconroy had gone for a stroll down to the Pilgrim’s Pond an hour before, and could not be traced since. 

Then Todd cried ‘Mighty Murder!’ and shut down the window vio lently; and I could hear him plunging down the stairs inside. 

Repossessing myself of my former and wiser purpose, I whipped out of the way of the gen eral search that must follow; and returned here not later than eight o’clock. 

“I now ask you to recall that little Society para graph which seemed to you so painfully lacking in interest. 

If the convict was not keeping the shot for Todd, as he evidently wasn’t, it is most likely that he was keeping it for Lord Falconroy; and it looks as if he had delivered the goods. 

No more handy place to shoot a man than in the curious geological sur roundings of that pool, where a body thrown down would sink through thick slime to a depth practical ly unknown. 

Let us suppose, then, that our friend 2301 THE MISTAKE OF THE MACHINE with the cropped hair came to kill Falconroy and not Todd. 

But, as I have pointed out, there are many reasons why people in America might want to kill Todd. 

There is no reason why anybody in America should want to kill an English lord newly landed, except for the one reason mentioned in the pink pa per — that the lord is paying his attentions to the millionaire’s daughter. 

Our crop haired friend, de spite his ill fitting clothes, must be an aspiring lover. 

“I know the notion will seem to you jarring and even comic; but that’s because you are English. 

It sounds to you like saying the Archbishop of Canter bury’s daughter will be married in St. 

George’s, Hanover Square, to a crossing sweeper on ticket of leave. 

You don’t do justice to the climbing and as piring power of our more remarkable citizens. 

You see a good looking grey haired man in evening dress with a sort of authority about him, you know he is a pillar of the State, and you fancy he had a fa ther. 

You are in error. 

You do not realize that a com paratively few years ago he may have been in a tene ment or (quite likely) in a jail. 

You don’t allow for our national buoyancy and uplift. 

Many of our most influential citizens have not only risen recently, but risen comparatively late in life. 

Todd’s daughter was fully eighteen when her father first made his pile1; made his pile — (зд.) нажил свое состояние 231G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON so there isn’t really anything impossible in her hav ing a hanger on in low life; or even in her hanging on to him, as I think she must be doing, to judge by the lantern business. 

If so, the hand that held the lantern may not be unconnected with the hand that held the gun. 

This case, sir, will make a noise.” “Well,” said the priest patiently, “and what did you do next?” “I reckon you’ll be shocked,” replied Greywood Usher, “as I know you don’t cotton1 to the march of science in these matters. 

I am given a good deal of discretion here, and perhaps take a little more than I’m given; and I thought it was an excellent oppor tunity to test that Psychometric Machine I told you about. 

Now, in my opinion, that machine can’t lie.” “No machine can lie,” said Father Brown; “nor can it tell the truth.” “It did in this case, as I’ll show you,” went on Usher positively. 

“I sat the man in the ill fitting clothes in a comfortable chair, and simply wrote words on a blackboard; and the machine simply re corded the variations of his pulse; and I simply ob served his manner. 

The trick is to introduce some word connected with the supposed crime in a list of words connected with something quite different, yet a list in which it occurs quite naturally. 

Thus I wrote 1 232 you don’t cotton — (разг.) вам не по душе1 2 THE MISTAKE OF THE MACHINE ‘heron’ and ‘eagle’ and ‘owl’, and when I wrote ‘fal con’ he was tremendously agitated; and when I began to make an ‘r’ at the end of the word, that machine just bounded. 

Who else in this republic has any rea son to jump at the name of a newly arrived English man like Falconroy except the man who’s shot him? Isn’t that better evidence than a lot of gabble from witnesses — if the evidence of a reliable machine?” “You always forget,” observed his companion, “that the reliable machine always has to be worked by an unreliable machine.” “Why, what do you mean?” asked the detective. 

“I mean Man,” said Father Brown, “the most un reliable machine I know of. 

I don’t want to be rude; and I don’t think you will consider Man to be an of fensive or inaccurate description of yourself. 

You say you observed his manner; but how do you know you observed it right? You say the words have to come in a natural way; but how do you know that you did it naturally? How do you know, if you come to that1, that he did not observe your manner? Who is to prove that you were not tremendously agitated? There was no machine tied on to your pulse.” “I tell you,” cried the American in the utmost ex citement, “I was as cool as a cucumber2.” if you come to that — (разг.) если уж на то пошло as cool as a cucumber — (ср. 

русск.) холоден как лед 233G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON “Criminals also can be as cool as cucumbers,” said Brown with a smile. 

“And almost as cool as you.” “Well, this one wasn’t,” said Usher, throwing the papers about. 

“Oh, you make me tired!” “I’m sorry,” said the other. 

“I only point out what seems a reasonable possibility. 

If you could tell by his manner when the word that might hang him had come, why shouldn’t he tell from your manner that the word that might hang him was coming? I should ask for more than words myself before I hanged anybody.” Usher smote the table and rose in a sort of angry triumph. 

“And that,” he cried, “is just what I’m going to give you. 

I tried the machine first just in order to test the thing in other ways afterwards and the ma chine, sir, is right.” He paused a moment and resumed with less ex citement. 

“I rather want to insist, if it comes to that, that so far I had very little to go on except the scien tific experiment. 

There was really nothing against the man at all. 

His clothes were ill fitting, as I’ve said, but they were rather better, if anything, than those of the submerged class to which he evidently belonged. 

Moreover, under all the stains of his plunging through ploughed fields or bursting through dusty hedges, the man was comparatively clean. 

This might mean, of course, that he had only just broken prison; 234THE MISTAKE OF THE MACHINE but it reminded me more of the desperate decency of the comparatively respectable poor. 

His demean our was, I am bound to confess, quite in accordance with theirs. 

He was silent and dignified as they are; he seemed to have a big, but buried, grievance, as they do. 

He professed total ignorance of the crime and the whole question; and showed nothing but a sullen impatience for something sensible that might come to take him out of his meaningless scrape. 

He asked me more than once1 if he could telephone for a lawyer who had helped him a long time ago in a trade dispute, and in every sense acted as you would expect an innocent man to act. 

There was nothing against him in the world except that little finger on the dial that pointed to the change of his pulse. 

“Then, sir, the machine was on its trial; and the machine was right. 

By the time I came with him out of the private room into the vestibule where all sorts of other people were awaiting examination, I think he had already more or less made up his mind to clear things up by something like a confession. 

He turned to me and began to say in a low voice: ‘Oh, I can’t stick this any more. 

If you must know all about me — ’ “At the same instant one of the poor women sitting on the long bench stood up, screaming aloud and 1 He asked me more than once — (разг.) не раз спра шивал меня 235G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON pointing at him with her finger. 

I have never in my life heard anything more demoniacally distinct. 

Her lean finger seemed to pick him out as if it were a pea shooter. 

Though the word was a mere howl, every syllable was as clear as a separate stroke on the clock. 

“‘Drugger Davis!’ she shouted. 

‘They’ve got Drugger Davis!’ “Among the wretched women, mostly thieves and streetwalkers, twenty faces were turned, gaping with glee and hate. 

If I had never heard the words, I should have known by the very shock upon his features that the so called Oscar Rian had heard his real name. 

But I’m not quite so ignorant, you may be surprised to hear. 

Drugger Davis was one of the most terrible and depraved criminals that ever baffled our police. 

It is certain he had done murder more than once long before his last exploit with the warder. 

But he was never entirely fixed for it, curiously enough because he did it in the same manner as those milder — or meaner — crimes for which he was fixed pretty often. 

He was a handsome, well bred looking brute, as he still is, to some extent; and he used mostly to go about with barmaids or shop girls and do them out of their money. 

Very often, though, he went a good deal farther; and they were found drugged with cigarettes or chocolates and their whole property missing. 

Then came one case where the girl was found dead; but deliberation 236THE MISTAKE OF THE MACHINE could not quite be proved, and, what was more prac tical still, the criminal could not be found. 

I heard a rumour of his having reappeared somewhere in the opposite character this time, lending money instead of borrowing it; but still to such poor widows as he might personally fascinate, but still with the same bad result for them. 

Well, there is your innocent man, and there is his innocent record. 

Even, since then, four criminals and three warders have identi fied him and confirmed the story. 

Now what have you got to say to my poor little machine after that? Hasn’t the machine done for him? Or do you prefer to say that the woman and I have done for him?” “As to what you’ve done for him,” replied Father Brown, rising and shaking himself in a floppy way, “you’ve saved him from the electrical chair. 

I don’t think they can kill Drugger Davis on that old vague story of the poison; and as for the convict who killed the warder, I suppose it’s obvious that you haven’t got him. 

Mr. 

Davis is innocent of that crime, at any rate.” “What do you mean?” demanded the other. 

“Why should he be innocent of that crime?” “Why, bless us all!” cried the small man in one of his rare moments of animation, “why, because he’s guilty of the other crimes! I don’t know what you people are made of. 

You seem to think that all sins are kept together in a bag. 

You talk as if a miser on Monday were always a spendthrift on Tuesday. 

You 237G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON tell me this man you have here spent weeks and months wheedling needy women out of small sums of money; that he used a drug at the best, and a poi son at the worst; that he turned up afterwards as the lowest kind of moneylender, and cheated most poor people in the same patient and pacific style. 

Let it be granted — let us admit, for the sake of argument, that he did all this. 

If that is so, I will tell you what he didn’t do. 

He didn’t storm a spiked wall against a man with a loaded gun. 

He didn’t write on the wall with his own hand, to say he had done it. 

He didn’t stop to state that his justification was self defence. 

He didn’t explain that he had no quarrel with the poor warder. 

He didn’t name the house of the rich man to which he was going with the gun. 

He didn’t write his own initials in a man’s blood. 

Saints alive!1 Can’t you see the whole character is different, in good and evil? Why, you don’t seem to be like I am a bit. 

One would think you’d never had any vices of your own.” The amazed American had already parted his lips in protest when the door of his private and official room was hammered and rattled in an unceremoni ous way to which he was totally unaccustomed. 

The door flew open. 

The moment before Grey wood Usher had been coming to the conclusion that 1 238 Saints alive! — (воскл.) Святые угодники!THE MISTAKE OF THE MACHINE Father Brown might possibly be mad. 

The moment after he began to think he was mad himself. 

There burst and fell into his private room a man in the filthiest rags, with a greasy squash hat still askew on his head, and a shabby green shade shoved up from one of his eyes, both of which were glaring like a ti ger’s. 

The rest of his face was almost undiscovera ble, being masked with a matted beard and whiskers through which the nose could barely thrust itself, and further buried in a squalid red scarf or handker chief. 

Mr. 

Usher prided himself on having seen most of the roughest specimens in the State, but he thought he had never seen such a baboon dressed as a scarecrow as this. 

But, above all, he had never in all his placid scientific existence heard a man like that speak to him first. 

“See here, old man Usher,” shouted the being in the red handkerchief, “I’m getting tired. 

Don’t you try any of your hide and seek on me; I don’t get fooled any.1 Leave go of my guests, and I’ll let up on the fancy clockwork. 

Keep him here for a split instant and you’ll feel pretty mean. 

I reckon I’m not a man with no pull2.” 1 I don’t get fooled any.

K. 

CHESTERTON The eminent Usher was regarding the bellowing monster with an amazement which had dried up all other sentiments. 

The mere shock to his eyes had rendered his ears, almost useless. 

At last he rang a bell with a hand of violence. 

While the bell was still strong and pealing, the voice of Father Brown fell soft but distinct. 

“I have a suggestion to make,” he said, “but it seems a little confusing. 

I don’t know this gentle man — but — but I think I know him. 

Now, you know him — you know him quite well — but you don’t know him — naturally. 

Sounds paradoxical, I know.” “I reckon the Cosmos is cracked,” said Usher, and fell asprawl in his round office chair. 

“Now, see here,” vociferated the stranger, strik ing the table, but speaking in a voice that was all the more mysterious because it was comparatively mild and rational though still resounding. 

“I won’t let you in. 

I want — ” “Who in hell are you?” yelled Usher, suddenly sitting up straight. 

“I think the gentleman’s name is Todd,” said the priest. 

Then he picked up the pink slip of newspaper. 

“I fear you don’t read the Society papers proper ly,” he said, and began to read out in a monotonous voice, “‘Or locked in the jewelled bosoms of our city’s gayest leaders; but there is talk of a pretty par 240THE MISTAKE OF THE MACHINE ody of the manners and customs of the other end of Society’s scale.’ There’s been a big Slum Dinner up at Pilgrim’s Pond tonight; and a man, one of the guests, disappeared. 

Mr. 

Ireton Todd is a good host, and has tracked him here, without even waiting to take off his fancy dress.” “What man do you mean?” “I mean the man with comically ill fitting clothes you saw running across the ploughed field. 

Hadn’t you better go and investigate him? He will be rather impatient to get back to his champagne, from which he ran away in such a hurry, when the convict with the gun hove in sight.” “Do you seriously mean — ” began the official. 

“Why, look here, Mr. 

Usher,” said Father Brown quietly, “you said the machine couldn’t make a mis take; and in one sense it didn’t. 

But the other ma chine did; the machine that worked it. 

You assumed that the man in rags jumped at the name of Lord Falconroy, because he was Lord Falconroy’s mur derer. 

He jumped at the name of Lord Falconroy be cause he is Lord Falconroy.” “Then why the blazes didn’t he say so?” demand ed the staring Usher. 

“He felt his plight and recent panic were hardly patrician,” replied the priest, “so he tried to keep the name back at first. 

But he was just going to tell it you, when” — and Father Brown looked down at his 241G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON boots — “when a woman found another name for him.” “But you can’t be so mad as to say,” said Grey wood Usher, very white, “that Lord Falconroy was Drugger Davis.” The priest looked at him very earnestly, but with a baffling and undecipherable face. 

“I am not saying anything about it,” he said. 

“I leave all the rest to you. 

Your pink paper says that the title was recently revived for him; but those papers are very unreliable. 

It says he was in the States in youth; but the whole story seems very strange. 

Davis and Falconroy are both pretty considerable cowards, but so are lots of other men. 

I would not hang a dog on my own opinion about this. 

But I think,” he went on softly and reflectively, “I think you Americans are too modest. 

I think you idealize the English aristoc racy — even in assuming it to be so aristocratic. 

You see a good looking Englishman in evening dress; you know he’s in the House of Lords; and you fancy he has a father. 

You don’t allow for our national buoy ancy and uplift. 

Many of our most influential noble men have not only risen recently, but — ” “Oh, stop it!” cried Greywood Usher, wringing one lean hand in impatience against a shade of iro ny in the other’s face. 

“Don’t stay talking to this lunatic!” cried Todd brutally. 

“Take me to my friend.” 2421 deshabille — (фр.) полураздеты THE MISTAKE OF THE MACHINE Next morning Father Brown appeared with the same demure expression, carrying yet another piece of pink newspaper. 

“I’m afraid you neglect the fashionable press rather,” he said, “but this cutting may interest you.” Usher read the headlines, “Last Trick’s Strayed Revellers: Mirthful Incident near Pilgrim’s Pond.” The paragraph went on: “A laughable occurrence took place outside Wilkinson’s Motor Garage last night. 

A policeman on duty had his attention drawn by lar rikins to a man in prison dress who was stepping with considerable coolness into the steering seat of a pretty high toned Panhard; he was accompanied by a girl wrapped in a ragged shawl. 

On the police interfering, the young woman threw back the shawl, and all recog nized Millionaire Todd’s daughter, who had just come from the Slum Freak Dinner at the Pond, where all the choicest guests were in a similar deshabille 1. 

She and the gentleman who had donned prison uniform were going for the customary joy ride.” Under the pink slip Mr. 

Usher found a strip of a later paper, headed, “Astounding Escape of Million aire’s Daughter with Convict. 

She had Arranged Freak Dinner. 

Now Safe in — ” Mr. 

Greenwood Usher lifted his eyes, but Father Brown was gone.The Perishing of the Pendragons F ATHER Brown was in no mood for adventures. 

He had lately fallen ill with over work, and when he began to recover, his friend Flambeau had taken him on a cruise in a small yacht with Sir Cecil Fanshaw, a young Cornish squire and an enthusiast for Cornish coast scenery. 

But Brown was still rath er weak; he was no very happy sailor1; and though he was never of the sort that either grumbles or breaks down, his spirits did not rise above patience and civility. 

When the other two men praised the ragged violet sunset or the ragged volcanic crags, he agreed with them. 

When Flambeau pointed out a rock shaped like a dragon, he looked at it and thought it very like a dragon. 

When Fanshaw more excitedly indicated a rock that was like Merlin, he looked at it, and signified assent. 

When Flambeau asked whether this rocky gate of the twisted river 1 he was no very happy sailor — (разг.) он плохо пе реносил качку 244THE PERISHING OF THE PENDRAGONS was not the gate of Fairyland, he said “Yes.” He heard the most important things and the most trivi al with the same tasteless absorption. 

He heard that the coast was death to all but careful seamen; he also heard that the ship’s cat was asleep. 

He heard that Fanshaw couldn’t find his cigar holder any where; he also heard the pilot deliver the oracle “Both eyes bright, she’s all right; one eye winks, down she sinks.” He heard Flambeau say to Fan shaw that no doubt this meant the pilot must keep both eyes open and be spry. 

And he heard Fanshaw say to Flambeau that, oddly enough, it didn’t mean this: it meant that while they saw two of the coast lights, one near and the other distant, exactly side by side, they were in the right river channel; but that if one light was hidden behind the other, they were going on the rocks. 

He heard Fanshaw add that his country was full of such quaint fables and idioms; it was the very home of romance; he even pitted this part of Cornwall against Devonshire, as a claimant to the laurels of Elizabethan seamanship. 

According to him there had been captains among these coves and islets compared with whom Drake1 was practically a landsman. 

He heard Flambeau 1 Drake — Сэр Френсис Дрейк (1540–1596), англий ский адмирал, исследователь, пират; совершил кругосвет ное путешествие (после Магеллана) 245G.

CHESTERTON laugh, and ask if, perhaps, the adventurous title of “Westward Ho!” only meant that all Devonshire men wished they were living in Cornwall. 

He heard Fanshaw say there was no need to be silly; that not only had Cornish captains been heroes, but that they were heroes still: that near that very spot there was an old admiral, now retired, who was scarred by thrilling voyages full of adventures; and who had in his youth found the last group of eight Pacific Is lands that was added to the chart of the world. 

This Cecil Fanshaw was, in person, of the kind that com monly urges such crude but pleasing enthusiasms; a very young man, light haired, high coloured, with an eager profile, with a boyish bravado of spirits, but an almost girlish delicacy of tint and type. 

The big shoulders, black brows and black mousquetaire swagger of Flambeau were a great contrast. 

All these trivialities Brown heard and saw; but heard them as a tired man hears a tune in the rail way wheels, or saw them as a sick man sees the pat tern of his wall paper. 

No one can calculate the turns of mood in convalescence: but Father Brown’s depression must have had a great deal to do with his mere unfamiliarity with the sea. 

For as the river mouth narrowed like the neck of a bottle, and the water grew calmer and the air warmer and more earthly, he seemed to wake up and take notice like a baby. 

They had reached that phase just after sunset 246THE PERISHING OF THE PENDRAGONS when air and water both look bright, but earth and all its growing things look almost black by compari son. 

About this particular evening, however, there was something exceptional. 

It was one of those rare atmospheres in which a smoked glass slide seems to have been slid away from between us and Nature; so that even dark colours on that day look more gor geous than bright colours on cloudier days. 

The trampled earth of the river banks and the peaty stain in the pools did not look drab but glowing um ber, and the dark woods astir in the breeze did not look, as usual, dim blue with mere depth of dis tance, but more like wind tumbled masses of some vivid violet blossom. 

This magic clearness and in tensity in the colours was further forced on Brown’s slowly reviving senses by something romantic and even secret in the very form of the landscape. 

The river was still well wide and deep enough for a pleasure boat so small as theirs; but the curves of the country side suggested that it was closing in on either hand; the woods seemed to be making broken and flying attempts at bridge building — as if the boat were passing from the romance of a valley to the romance of a hollow and so to the supreme ro mance of a tunnel. 

Beyond this mere look of things there was little for Brown’s freshening fancy to feed on; he saw no human beings, except some gipsies trailing along the river bank, with faggots and osiers 247G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON cut in the forest; and one sight no longer unconven tional, but in such remote parts still uncommon: a dark haired lady, bare headed, and paddling her own canoe. 

If Father Brown ever attached any im portance to either of these, he certainly forgot them at the next turn of the river which brought in sight a singular object. 

The water seemed to widen and split, being clo ven by the dark wedge of a fish shaped and wooded islet. 

With the rate at which they went, the islet seemed to swim towards them like a ship; a ship with a very high prow — or, to speak more strictly, a very high funnel. 

For at the extreme point nearest them stood up an odd looking building, unlike any thing they could remember or connect with any purpose. 

It was not specially high, but it was too high for its breadth to be called anything but a tow er. 

Yet it appeared to be built entirely of wood, and that in a most unequal and eccentric way. 

Some of the planks and beams were of good, seasoned oak; some of such wood cut raw and recent; some again of white pinewood, and a great deal more of the same sort of wood painted black with tar. 

These black beams were set crooked or crisscross at all kinds of angles, giving the whole a most patchy and puzzling appearance. 

There were one or two win dows, which appeared to be coloured and leaded in an old fashioned but more elaborate style. 

The trav 248THE PERISHING OF THE PENDRAGONS ellers looked at it with that paradoxical feeling we have when something reminds us of something, and yet we are certain it is something very different. 

Father Brown, even when he was mystified, was clever in analysing his own mystification. 

And he found himself reflecting that the oddity seemed to consist in a particular shape cut out in an incongru ous material; as if one saw a top hat made of tin, or a frock coat cut out of tartan. 

He was sure he had seen timbers of different tints arranged like that somewhere, but never in such architectural propor tions. 

The next moment a glimpse through the dark trees told him all he wanted to know and he laughed. 

Through a gap in the foliage there ap peared for a moment one of those old wooden hous es, faced with black beams, which are still to be found here and there in England, but which most of us see imitated in some show called “Old London” or “Shakespeare’s England”. 

It was in view only long enough for the priest to see that, however old fashioned, it was a comfortable and well kept coun try house, with flower beds in front of it. 

It had none of the piebald and crazy look of the tower that seemed made out of its refuse. 

“What on earth’s this?” said Flambeau, who was still staring at the tower. 

Fanshaw’s eyes were shining, and he spoke tri umphantly. 

“Aha! you’ve not seen a place quite like 249G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON this before, I fancy; that’s why I’ve brought you here, my friend. 

Now you shall see whether I exag gerate about the mariners of Cornwall. 

This place belongs to Old Pendragon, whom we call the Admi ral; though he retired before getting the rank. 

The spirit of Raleigh1 and Hawkins2 is a memory with the Devon folk; it’s a modern fact with the Pendrag ons. 

If Queen Elizabeth3 were to rise from the grave and come up this river in a gilded barge, she would be received by the Admiral in a house exactly such as she was accustomed to, in every corner and case ment, in every panel on the wall or plate on the ta ble. 

And she would find an English Captain still talking fiercely of fresh lands to be found in little ships, as much as if she had dined with Drake.” “She’d find a rum sort of thing in the garden,” said Father Brown, “which would not please her Renaissance eye. 

That Elizabethan domestic archi tecture is charming in its way; but it’s against the very nature of it to break out into turrets.” “And yet,” answered Fanshaw, “that’s the most romantic and Elizabethan part of the business.

The story goes that the lady of Sir Peter Pendragon built it in this place and to this height, because from the top you can just see the corner where vessels turn into the river mouth; and she wished to be the first to see her husband’s ship, as he sailed home from the Spanish Main1.” “For what other reason,” asked Father Brown, “do you mean that it has been rebuilt?” “Oh, there’s a strange story about that, too,” said the young squire with relish. 

“You are really in a land of strange stories. 

King Arthur2 was here and Merlin3 and the fairies before him. 

The story goes that Sir Peter Pendragon, who (I fear) had some of the faults of the pirates as well as the virtues of the sailor, was bringing home three Spanish gentlemen in honourable captivity, intending to escort them to Elizabeth’s court. 

But he was a man of flaming and tigerish temper, and coming to high words with one of them, he caught him by the throat and flung him 1 Spanish Main — Карибское море, путь, по которому двигались испанские галеоны с сокровищами 2 King Arthur — Король Артур, легендарный прави тель Британии 3 Merlin — волшебник из «Легенд Круглого стола» 251G.

CHESTERTON by accident or design, into the sea. 

A second Spani ard, who was the brother of the first, instantly drew his sword and flew at Pendragon, and after a short but furious combat in which both got three wounds in as many minutes, Pendragon drove his blade through the other’s body and the second Spaniard was accounted for1. 

As it happened the ship had al ready turned into the river mouth and was close to comparatively shallow water. 

The third Spaniard sprang over the side of the ship, struck out for the shore, and was soon near enough to it to stand up to his waist in water. 

And turning again to face the ship, and holding up both arms to Heaven — like a prophet calling plagues upon a wicked city — he called out to Pendragon in a piercing and terrible voice, that he at least was yet living, that he would go on living, that he would live forever; and that generation after generation the house of Pendragon should never see him or his, but should know by very certain signs that he and his vengeance were alive. 

With that he dived under the wave, and was either drowned or swam so long under water that no hair of his head was seen afterwards.” “There’s that girl in the canoe again,” said Flam beau irrelevantly, for good looking young women 1 252 was accounted for — (разг.) было поконченоTHE PERISHING OF THE PENDRAGONS would call him off any topic1. 

“She seems bothered by the queer tower just as we were.” Indeed, the black haired young lady was letting her canoe float slowly and silently past the strange islet; and was looking intently up at the strange tower, with a strong glow of curiosity on her oval and olive face. 

“Never mind girls,” said Fanshaw impatiently, “there are plenty of them in the world, but not many things like the Pendragon Tower. 

As you may easily suppose, plenty of superstitions and scandals have followed in the track of the Spaniard’s curse; and no doubt, as you would put it, any accident happening to this Cornish family would be connected with it by rural credulity. 

But it is perfectly true that this tower has been burnt down two or three times; and the family can’t be called lucky, for more than two, I think, of the Admiral’s near kin have perished by shipwreck; and one at least, to my own knowledge, on practically the same spot where Sir Peter threw the Spaniard overboard.” “What a pity!” exclaimed Flambeau. 

“She’s go ing.” “When did your friend the Admiral tell you this family history?” asked Father Brown, as the girl in 1 would call him off any topic — (разг.) собьет его с мысли; заставит сменить тему 253G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON the canoe paddled off, without showing the least in tention of extending her interest from the tower to the yacht, which Fanshaw had already caused to lie alongside the island. 

“Many years ago,” replied Fanshaw; “he hasn’t been to sea for some time now, though he is as keen on it as ever. 

I believe there’s a family compact or something. 

Well, here’s the landing stage; let’s come ashore and see the old boy.” They followed him on to the island, just under the tower, and Father Brown, whether from the mere touch of dry land, or the interest of something on the other bank of the river (which he stared at very hard for some seconds), seemed singularly im proved in briskness. 

They entered a wooded avenue between two fences of thin greyish wood, such as often enclose parks or gardens, and over the top of which the dark trees tossed to and fro like black and purple plumes upon the hearse of a giant. 

The tow er, as they left it behind, looked all the quainter, be cause such entrances are usually flanked by two towers; and this one looked lopsided. 

But for this, the avenue had the usual appearance of the en trance to a gentleman’s grounds; and, being so curved that the house was now out of sight, some how looked a much larger park than any plantation on such an island could really be. 

Father Brown was, perhaps, a little fanciful in his fatigue, but he almost 254THE PERISHING OF THE PENDRAGONS thought the whole place must be growing larger, as things do in a nightmare. 

Anyhow, a mystical mo notony was the only character of their march, until Fanshaw suddenly stopped, and pointed to some thing sticking out through the grey fence — some thing that looked at first rather like the imprisoned horn of some beast. 

Closer observation showed that it was a slightly curved blade of metal that shone faintly in the fading light. 

Flambeau, who like all Frenchmen had been a soldier, bent over it and said in a startled voice: “Why, it’s a sabre! I believe I know the sort, heavy and curved, but shorter than the cavalry; they used to have them in artillery and the — ” As he spoke the blade plucked itself out of the crack it had made and came down again with a more ponderous slash, splitting the fussiparous fence to the bottom with a rending noise. 

Then it was pulled out again, flashed above the fence some feet further along, and again split it halfway down with the first stroke; and after waggling a little to extricate itself (accompanied with curses in the darkness) split it down to the ground with a second. 

Then a kick of devilish energy sent the whole loosened square of thin wood flying into the pathway, and a great gap of dark coppice gaped in the paling. 

Fanshaw peered into the dark opening and ut tered an exclamation of astonishment. 

“My dear 255G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON Admiral!” he exclaimed, “do you — er — do you generally cut out a new front door whenever you want to go for a walk?” The voice in the gloom swore again, and then broke into a jolly laugh. 

“No,” it said; “I’ve really got to cut down this fence somehow; it’s spoiling all the plants, and no one else here can do it. 

But I’ll only carve another bit off the front door, and then come out and welcome you.” And sure enough, he heaved up his weapon once more, and, hacking twice, brought down another and similar strip of fence, making the opening about fourteen feet wide in all. 

Then through this larger forest gateway he came out into the evening light, with a chip of grey wood sticking to his sword blade. 

He momentarily fulfilled all Fanshaw’s fable of an old piratical Admiral; though the details seemed afterwards to decompose into accidents. 

For instance, he wore a broad brimmed hat as protection against the sun; but the front flap of it was turned up straight to the sky, and the two corners pulled down lower than the ears, so that it stood across his forehead in a crescent like the old cocked hat worn by Nelson. 

He wore an ordinary dark blue jacket, with nothing special about the buttons, but the combination of it with white linen trousers somehow had a sailorish look. 

He was tall and loose, and walked with a sort 256THE PERISHING OF THE PENDRAGONS of swagger, which was not a sailor’s roll, and yet somehow suggested it; and he held in his hand a short sabre which was like a navy cutlass, but about twice as big. 

Under the bridge of the hat his eagle face looked eager, all the more because it was not only clean shaven, but without eyebrows. 

It seemed almost as if all the hair had come off his face from his thrusting it through a throng of elements. 

His eyes were prominent and piercing. 

His colour was cu riously attractive, while partly tropical; it reminded one vaguely of a blood orange. 

That is, that while it was ruddy and sanguine, there was a yellow in it that was in no way sickly, but seemed rather to glow like gold apples of the Hesperides1 — Father Brown thought he had never seen a figure so expressive of all the romances about the countries of the Sun. 

When Fanshaw had presented his two friends to their host he fell again into a tone of rallying the lat ter about his wreckage of the fence and his apparent rage of profanity. 

The Admiral pooh poohed it at first as a piece of necessary but annoying garden work; but at length the ring of real energy came back into his laughter, and he cried with a mixture of impatience and good humour: 1 gold apples of the Hesperides — в греческой мифо логии похищение яблок из сада Гесперид, охранявшегося драконом, — один из подвигов Геракла 257G.

So would you if your only pleasure was in cruising about to find some new Cannibal Islands, and you had to stick on this muddy little rockery in a sort of rustic pond. 

When I remember how I’ve cut down a mile and a half of green poisonous jungle with an old cutlass half as sharp as this; and then remember I must stop here and chop this matchwood, because of some confounded old bargain scribbled in a fami ly Bible, why, I — ” He swung up the heavy steel again; and this time sundered the wall of wood from top to bottom at one stroke. 

“I feel like that,” he said laughing, but furiously flinging the sword some yards down the path, “and now let’s go up to the house; you must have some dinner.” The semicircle of lawn in front of the house was varied by three circular garden beds, one of red tu lips, a second of yellow tulips, and the third of some white, waxen looking blossoms that the visitors did not know and presumed to be exotic. 

A heavy, hairy and rather sullen looking gardener was hanging up a heavy coil of garden hose. 

The corners of the ex piring sunset which seemed to cling about the cor ners of the house gave glimpses here and there of the colours of remoter flowerbeds; and in a treeless 258THE PERISHING OF THE PENDRAGONS space on one side of the house opening upon the river stood a tall brass tripod on which was tilted a big brass telescope. 

Just outside the steps of the porch stood a little painted green garden table, as if someone had just had tea there. 

The entrance was flanked with two of those half featured lumps of stone with holes for eyes that are said to be South Sea idols; and on the brown oak beam across the doorway were some confused carvings that looked almost as barbaric. 

As they passed indoors, the little cleric hopped suddenly on to the table, and standing on it peered unaffectedly through his spectacles at the mould ings in the oak. 

Admiral Pendragon looked very much astonished, though not particularly annoyed; while Fanshaw was so amused with what looked like a performing pigmy on his little stand, that he could not control his laughter. 

But Father Brown was not likely to notice either the laughter or the astonish ment. 

He was gazing at three carved symbols, which, though very worn and obscure, seemed still to con vey some sense to him. 

The first seemed to be the outline of some tower or other building, crowned with what looked like curly pointed ribbons. 

The second was clearer: an old Elizabethan galley with decorative waves beneath it, but interrupted in the middle by a curious jagged rock, which was either a 259G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON fault in the wood or some conventional representa tion of the water coming in. 

The third represented the upper half of a human figure, ending in an es calloped line like the waves; the face was rubbed and featureless, and both arms were held very stiffly up in the air. 

“Well,” muttered Father Brown, blinking, “here is the legend of the Spaniard plain enough. 

Here he is holding up his arms and cursing in the sea; and here are the two curses: the wrecked ship and the burning of Pendragon Tower.” Pendragon shook his head with a kind of vener able amusement. 

“And how many other things might it not be?” he said. 

“Don’t you know that that sort of half man, like a half lion or half stag, is quite common in heraldry? Might not that line through the ship be one of those parti per pale lines, indented, I think they call it? And though the third thing isn’t so very heraldic, it would be more heraldic to suppose it a tower crowned with laurel than with fire; and it looks just as like it.” “But it seems rather odd,” said Flambeau, “that it should exactly confirm the old legend.” “Ah,” replied the sceptical traveller, “but you don’t know how much of the old legend may have been made up from the old figures. 

Besides, it isn’t the only old legend. 

Fanshaw, here, who is fond of such things, will tell you there are other versions of 260THE PERISHING OF THE PENDRAGONS the tale, and much more horrible ones. 

One story credits my unfortunate ancestor with having had the Spaniard cut in two; and that will fit the pretty picture also. 

Another obligingly credits our family with the possession of a tower full of snakes and ex plains those little, wriggly things in that way. 

And a third theory supposes the crooked line on the ship to be a conventionalized thunderbolt; but that alone, if seriously examined, would show what a very little way these unhappy coincidences really go.” “Why, how do you mean?” asked Fanshaw. 

“It so happens,” replied his host coolly, “that there was no thunder and lightning at all in the two or three shipwrecks I know of in our family.” “Oh!” said Father Brown, and jumped down from the little table. 

There was another silence in which they heard the continuous murmur of the river; then Fanshaw said, in a doubtful and perhaps disappointed tone: “Then you don’t think there is anything in the tales of the tower in flames?” “There are the tales, of course,” said the Admiral, shrugging his shoulders; “and some of them, I don’t deny, on evidence as decent as one ever gets for such things. 

Someone saw a blaze hereabout, don’t you know, as he walked home through a wood; some one keeping sheep on the uplands inland thought he saw a flame hovering over Pendragon Tower. 

261G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON Well, a damp dab of mud like this confounded island seems the last place where one would think of fires.” “What is that fire over there?” asked Father Brown with a gentle suddenness, pointing to the woods on the left river bank. 

They were all thrown a little off their balance, and the more fanciful Fan shaw had even some difficulty in recovering his, as they saw a long, thin stream of blue smoke ascend ing silently into the end of the evening light. 

Then Pendragon broke into a scornful laugh again. 

“Gipsies!” he said; “they’ve been camping about here for about a week. 

Gentlemen, you want your dinner,” and he turned as if to enter the house. 

But the antiquarian superstition in Fanshaw was still quivering, and he said hastily: “But, Admiral, what’s that hissing noise quite near the island? It’s very like fire.” “It’s more like what it is,” said the Admiral, laugh ing as he led the way; “it’s only some canoe going by.” Almost as he spoke, the butler, a lean man in black, with very black hair and a very long, yellow face, appeared in the doorway and told him that dinner was served. 

The dining room was as nautical as the cabin of a ship; but its note was rather that of the modern than the Elizabethan captain. 

There were, indeed, three antiquated cutlasses in a trophy over the fire place, and one brown sixteenth century map with 2621 THE PERISHING OF THE PENDRAGONS Tritons and little ships dotted about a curly sea. 

But such things were less prominent on the white panel ling than some cases of quaint coloured South American birds, very scientifically stuffed, fantastic shells from the Pacific, and several instruments so rude and queer in shape that savages might have used them either to kill their enemies or to cook them. 

But the alien colour culminated in the fact that, besides the butler, the Admiral’s only servants were two negroes, somewhat quaintly clad in tight uniforms of yellow. 

The priest’s instinctive trick of analysing his own impressions told him that the col our and the little neat coat tails of these bipeds had suggested the word “Canary,” and so by a mere pun connected them with southward travel. 

Towards the end of the dinner they took their yellow clothes and black faces out of the room, leaving only the black clothes and yellow face of the butler. 

“I’m rather sorry you take this so lightly,” said Fanshaw to the host; “for the truth is, I’ve brought these friends of mine with the idea of their helping you, as they know a good deal of these things. 

Don’t you really believe in the family story at all?” “I don’t believe in anything,” answered Pendrag on very briskly, with a bright eye cocked at a red tropical bird. 

“I’m a man of science.1” I’m a man of science.

CHESTERTON Rather to Flambeau’s surprise, his clerical friend, who seemed to have entirely woken up, took up the digression and talked natural history with his host with a flow of words and much unexpected informa tion, until the dessert and decanters were set down and the last of the servants vanished. 

Then he said, without altering his tone: “Please don’t think me impertinent, Admiral Pendragon. 

I don’t ask for curiosity, but really for my guidance and your convenience. 

Have I made a bad shot if I guess1 you don’t want these old things talked of before your butler?” The Admiral lifted the hairless arches over his eyes and exclaimed: “Well, I don’t know where you got it, but the truth is I can’t stand the fellow, though I’ve no excuse for discharging a family serv ant. 

Fanshaw, with his fairy tales, would say my blood moved against men with that black, Spanish looking hair.” Flambeau struck the table with his heavy fist. 

“By Jove!” he cried; “and so had that girl!” “I hope it’ll all end tonight,” continued the Ad miral, “when my nephew comes back safe from his ship. 

You looked surprised. 

You won’t understand, I 1 Have I made a bad shot if I guess — Ошибусь ли я, предположив 264THE PERISHING OF THE PENDRAGONS suppose, unless I tell you the story. 

You see, my fa ther had two sons; I remained a bachelor, but my elder brother married, and had a son who became a sailor like all the rest of us, and will inherit the proper estate. 

Well, my father was a strange man; he somehow combined Fanshaw’s superstition with a good deal of my scepticism — they were always fighting in him; and after my first voyages, he devel oped a notion which he thought somehow would settle finally whether the curse was truth or trash. 

If all the Pendragons sailed about anyhow, he thought there would be too much chance of natural catastro phes to prove anything. 

But if we went to sea one at a time in strict order of succession to the property, he thought it might show whether any connected fate followed the family as a family. 

It was a silly notion, I think, and I quarrelled with my father pretty heartily; for I was an ambitious man and was left to the last, coming, by succession, after my own nephew.” “And your father and brother,” said the priest, very gently, “died at sea, I fear.” “Yes,” groaned the Admiral; “by one of those brutal accidents on which are built all the lying my thologies of mankind, they were both shipwrecked. 

My father, coming up this coast out of the Atlantic, was washed up on these Cornish rocks. 

My brother’s ship was sunk, no one knows where, on the voyage 265G.

His body was never found. 

I tell you it was from perfectly natural mishap; lots of other people besides Pendragons were drowned; and both disasters are discussed in a normal way by navigators. 

But, of course, it set this forest of super stition on fire; and men saw the flaming tower eve rywhere. 

That’s why I say it will be all right when Walter returns. 

The girl he’s engaged to was coming today; but I was so afraid of some chance delay frightening her that I wired her not to come till she heard from me. 

But he’s practically sure to be here some time tonight, and then it’ll all end in smoke — tobacco smoke. 

We’ll crack that old lie when we crack a bottle of this wine.” “Very good wine,” said Father Brown, gravely lifting his glass, “but, as you see, a very bad wine bibber. 

I most sincerely beg your pardon,” for he had spilt a small spot of wine on the table cloth. 

He drank and put down the glass with a composed face; but his hand had started at the exact moment when he became conscious of a face looking in through the garden window just behind the Admiral — the face of a woman, swarthy, with southern hair and eyes, and young, but like a mask of tragedy. 

1 Tasmania — остров к югу от Австралии, государство, входящее в Австралийское содружество 2661 THE PERISHING OF THE PENDRAGONS After a pause the priest spoke again in his mild manner. 

“Admiral,” he said, “will you do me a fa vour? Let me, and my friends if they like, stop in that tower of yours just for tonight? Do you know that in my business you’re an exorcist almost before anything else1?” Pendragon sprang to his feet and paced swiftly to and fro across the window, from which the face had instantly vanished. 

“I tell you there is nothing in it,” he cried, with ringing violence. 

“There is one thing I know about this matter. 

You may call me an atheist. 

I am an atheist.” Here he swung round and fixed Fa ther Brown with a face of frightful concentration. 

“This business is perfectly natural. 

There is no curse in it at all.” Father Brown smiled. 

“In that case,” he said, “there can’t be any objection to my sleeping in your delightful summer house.” “The idea is utterly ridiculous,” replied the Ad miral, beating a tattoo on the back of his chair. 

“Please forgive me for everything,” said Brown in his most sympathetic tone, “including spilling the wine. 

But it seems to me you are not quite so easy about the flaming tower as you try to be.” Admiral Pendragon sat down again as abruptly as he had risen; but he sat quite still, and when he almost before anything else — (зд.) прежде всего 267G.

CHESTERTON spoke again it was in a lower voice. 

“You do it at your own peril1,” he said; “but wouldn’t you be an atheist to keep sane in all this devilry?” Some three hours afterwards Fanshaw, Flambeau and the priest were still dawdling about the garden in the dark; and it began to dawn on the other two that Father Brown had no intention of going to bed either in the tower or the house. 

“I think the lawn wants weeding,” said he dreamily. 

“If I could find a spud or something I’d do it myself.” They followed him, laughing and half remon strating; but he replied with the utmost solemnity, explaining to them, in a maddening little sermon, that one can always find some small occupation that is helpful to others. 

He did not find a spud; but he found an old broom made of twigs, with which he began energetically to brush the fallen leaves off the grass. 

“Always some little thing to be done,” he said with idiotic cheerfulness; “as George Herbert2 says: ‘Who sweeps an Admiral’s garden in Cornwall as for thy laws makes that and the action fine.’ And now,” he added, suddenly slinging the broom away, “Let’s go and water the flowers.” 1 You do it at your own peril — (зд.) Поступайте как знаете 2 George Herbert — Джордж Герберт (1593–1633), ан глийский священник и поэт 268THE PERISHING OF THE PENDRAGONS With the same mixed emotions they watched him uncoil some considerable lengths of the large gar den hose, saying with an air of wistful discrimina tion: “The red tulips before the yellow, I think. 

Look a bit dry, don’t you think?” He turned the little tap on the instrument, and the water shot out straight and solid as a long rod of steel. 

“Look out, Samson,” cried Flambeau; “why, you’ve cut off the tulip’s head.” Father Brown stood ruefully contemplating the decapitated plant. 

“Mine does seem to be a rather kill or cure sort of watering,” he admitted, scratching his head. 

“I sup pose it’s a pity I didn’t find the spud. 

You should have seen me with the spud! Talking of tools, you’ve got that swordstick, Flambeau, you always carry? That’s right; and Sir Cecil could have that sword the Admiral threw away by the fence here. 

How grey everything looks!” “The mist’s rising from the river,” said the staring Flambeau. 

Almost as he spoke the huge figure of the hairy gardener appeared on a higher ridge of the trenched and terraced lawn, hailing them with a brandished rake and a horribly bellowing voice. 

“Put down that hose,” he shouted; “put down that hose and go to your — ” 269G.

CHESTERTON “I am fearfully clumsy,” replied the reverend gen tleman weakly; “do you know, I upset some wine at dinner.” He made a wavering half turn of apology towards the gardener, with the hose still spouting in his hand. 

The gardener caught the cold crash of the water full in his face like the crash of a cannon ball; staggered, slipped and went sprawling with his boots in the air. 

“How very dreadful!” said Father Brown, looking round in a sort of wonder. 

“Why, I’ve hit a man!” He stood with his head forward for a moment as if looking or listening; and then set off at a trot to wards the tower, still trailing the hose behind him. 

The tower was quite close, but its outline was curi ously dim. 

“Your river mist,” he said, “has a rum smell.” “By the Lord it has,” cried Fanshaw, who was very white. 

“But you can’t mean — ” “I mean,” said Father Brown, “that one of the Admiral’s scientific predictions is coming true to night. 

This story is going to end in smoke.” As he spoke a most beautiful rose red light seemed to burst into blossom like a gigantic rose; but accompanied with a crackling and rattling noise that was like the laughter of devils. 

“My God! What is this?” cried Sir Cecil Fanshaw. 

“The sign of the flaming tower,” said Father Brown, and sent the driving water from his hose 2701 THE PERISHING OF THE PENDRAGONS into the heart of the red patch. 

“Lucky we hadn’t gone to bed!” ejaculated Fan shaw. 

“I suppose it can’t spread to the house.” “You may remember,” said the priest quietly, “that the wooden fence that might have carried it was cut away.” Flambeau turned electrified eyes upon his friend, but Fanshaw only said rather absently: “Well, no body can be killed, anyhow.” “This is rather a curious kind of tower,” observed Father Brown, “when it takes to killing people, it al ways kills people who are somewhere else.” At the same instant the monstrous figure of the gardener with the streaming beard stood again on the green ridge against the sky, waving others to come on; but now waving not a rake but a cutlass. 

Behind him came the two negroes, also with the old crooked cutlasses out of the trophy. 

But in the blood red glare, with their black faces and yellow figures, they looked like devils carrying instruments of torture. 

In the dim garden behind them a distant voice was heard calling out brief directions. 

When the priest heard the voice, a terrible change came over his countenance. 

But he remained composed; and never took his eye off1 the patch of flame which had begun by never took his eye off — (разг.) не спуская глаз 271G.

CHESTERTON spreading, but now seemed to shrink a little as it hissed under the torch of the long silver spear of water. 

He kept his finger along the nozzle of the pipe to ensure the aim1, and attended to no other business, knowing only by the noise and that semi conscious corner of the eye, the exciting incidents that began to tumble themselves about the island garden. 

He gave two brief directions to his friends. 

One was: “Knock these fellows down somehow and tie them up, whoever they are; there’s rope down by those faggots. 

They want to take away my nice hose.” The other was: “As soon as you get a chance, call out to that canoeing girl; she’s over on the bank with the gipsies. 

Ask her if they could get some buckets across and fill them from the river.” Then he closed his mouth and continued to water the new red flower as ruthlessly as he had watered the red tulip. 

He never turned his head to look at the strange fight that followed between the foes and friends of the mysterious fire. 

He almost felt the island shake when Flambeau collided with the huge gardener; he merely imagined how it would whirl round them as they wrestled. 

He heard the crashing fall; and his friend’s gasp of triumph as he dashed on to the first negro; and the cries of both the blacks as Flambeau and Fanshaw bound them. 

Flambeau’s enormous 1 272 to ensure the aim — (разг.) чтобы точнее прицелитьсяTHE PERISHING OF THE PENDRAGONS strength more than redressed the odds in the fight, especially as the fourth man still hovered near the house, only a shadow and a voice. 

He heard also the water broken by the paddles of a canoe; the girl’s voice giving orders, the voices of gipsies answering and coming nearer, the plumping and sucking noise of empty buckets plunged into a full stream; and fi nally the sound of many feet around the fire. 

But all this was less to him than the fact that the red rent, which had lately once more increased, had once more slightly diminished. 

Then came a cry that very nearly made him turn his head. 

Flambeau and Fanshaw, now reinforced by some of the gipsies, had rushed after the mysterious man by the house; and he heard from the other end of the garden the Frenchman’s cry of horror and as tonishment. 

It was echoed by a howl not to be called human, as the being broke from their hold and ran along the garden. 

Three times at least it raced round the whole island, in a way that was as horrible as the chase of a lunatic, both in the cries of the pursued and the ropes carried by the pursuers; but was more horrible still, because it somehow suggested one of the chasing games of children in a garden. 

Then, finding them closing in on every side, the figure sprang upon one of the higher river banks and dis appeared with a splash into the dark and driving river.

CHESTERTON “You can do no more, I fear,” said Brown in a voice cold with pain. 

“He has been washed down to the rocks by now, where he has sent so many others. 

He knew the use of a family legend.” “Oh, don’t talk in these parables,” cried Flam beau impatiently. 

“Can’t you put it simply in words of one syllable?” “Yes,” answered Brown, with his eye on the hose. 

“‘Both eyes bright, she’s all right; one eye blinks, down she sinks.’” The fire hissed and shrieked more and more, like a strangled thing, as it grew narrower and narrower under the flood from the pipe and buckets, but Fa ther Brown still kept his eye on it as he went on speaking: “I thought of asking this young lady, if it were morning yet1, to look through that telescope at the river mouth and the river. 

She might have seen something to interest her: the sign of the ship, or Mr. 

Walter Pendragon coming home, and perhaps even the sign of the half man, for though he is cer tainly safe by now, he may very well have waded ashore. 

He has been within a shave of another ship wreck; and would never have escaped it, if the lady hadn’t had the sense to suspect the old Admiral’s 1 if it were morning yet — (разг.) несмотря на то, что было утро 274THE PERISHING OF THE PENDRAGONS telegram and come down to watch him. 

Don’t let’s talk about the old Admiral. 

Don’t let’s talk about anything. 

It’s enough to say that whenever this tow er, with its pitch and resin wood, really caught fire, the spark on the horizon always looked like the twin light to the coast light house.” “And that,” said Flambeau, “is how the father and brother died. 

The wicked uncle of the legends very nearly got his estate after all.” Father Brown did not answer; indeed, he did not speak again, save for civilities, till they were all safe round a cigar box in the cabin of the yacht. 

He saw that the frustrated fire was extinguished; and then refused to linger, though he actually heard young Pendragon, escorted by an enthusiastic crowd, come tramping up the river bank; and might (had he been moved by romantic curiosities) have received the combined thanks of the man from the ship and the girl from the canoe. 

But his fatigue had fallen on him once more, and he only started once, when Flambeau abruptly told him he had dropped cigar ash on his trousers. 

“That’s no cigar ash,” he said rather wearily. 

“That’s from the fire, but you don’t think so because you’re all smoking cigars. 

That’s just the way I got my first faint suspicion about the chart.” “Do you mean Pendragon’s chart of his Pacific Islands?” asked Fanshaw.

“Put a feather with a fossil and a bit of coral and everyone will think it’s a speci men. 

Put the same feather with a ribbon and an ar tificial flower and everyone will think it’s for a lady’s hat. 

Put the same feather with an ink bottle, a book and a stack of writing paper, and most men will swear they’ve seen a quill pen. 

So you saw that map among tropic birds and shells and thought it was a map of Pacific Islands. 

It was the map of this river.” “But how do you know?” asked Fanshaw. 

“I saw the rock you thought was like a dragon, and the one like Merlin, and — ” “You seem to have noticed a lot as we came in,” cried Fanshaw. 

“We thought you were rather ab stracted.” “I was sea sick,” said Father Brown simply. 

“I felt simply horrible. 

But feeling horrible has nothing to do with not seeing things.” And he closed his eyes. 

“Do you think most men would have seen that?” asked Flambeau. 

He received no answer: Father Brown was asleep.The Strange Crime of John Boulnois M R. 

Calhoun Kidd was a very young gentle man with a very old face, a face dried up with its own eagerness, framed in blue black hair and a black butterfly tie. 

He was the emissary in England of the colossal American daily called the Western Sun — also humorously described as the “Rising Sunset”. 

This was in allusion to a great jour nalistic declaration (attributed to Mr. 

Kidd himself) that “he guessed the sun would rise in the west yet, if American citizens did a bit more hustling.” Those, however, who mock American journalism from the standpoint of somewhat mellower traditions forget a certain paradox which partly redeems it. 

For while the journalism of the States permits a pantomimic vulgarity long past anything English, it also shows a real excitement about the most earnest mental problems, of which English papers are innocent, or rather incapable. 

The Sun was full of the most solemn matters treated in the most farcical way. 

William James figured there as well as “Weary Willie,” and 277G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON pragmatists alternated with pugilists in the long procession of its portraits. 

Thus, when a very unobtrusive Oxford man named John Boulnois wrote in a very unreadable re view called the Natural Philosophy Quarterly a series of articles on alleged weak points in Darwinian evo lution, it fluttered no corner of the English papers; though Boulnois’s theory (which was that of a com paratively stationary universe visited occasionally by convulsions of change) had some rather faddy fashionableness at Oxford, and got so far as to be named “Catastrophism”. 

But many American pa pers seized on the challenge as a great event; and the Sun threw the shadow of Mr. 

Boulnois quite gi gantically across its pages. 

By the paradox already noted, articles of valuable intelligence and enthusi asm were presented with headlines apparently writ ten by an illiterate maniac, headlines such as “Dar win Chews Dirt; Critic Boulnois says He Jumps the Shocks” or “Keep Catastrophic, says Thinker Boul nois.” And Mr. 

Calhoun Kidd, of the Western Sun, was bidden to take his butterfly tie and lugubrious visage down to the little house outside Oxford where Thinker Boulnois lived in happy ignorance of such a title. 

That fated philosopher had consented, in a somewhat dazed manner, to receive the interviewer, and had named the hour of nine that evening. 

The 278THE STRANGE CRIME OF JOHN BOULNOIS last of a summer sunset clung about Cumnor and the low wooded hills; the romantic Yankee was both doubtful of his road and inquisitive about his sur roundings; and seeing the door of a genuine feudal old country inn, The Champion Arms, standing open, he went in to make inquiries. 

In the bar parlour he rang the bell, and had to wait some little time for a reply to it. 

The only other person present was a lean man with close red hair and loose, horsey looking clothes, who was drink ing very bad whisky, but smoking a very good cigar. 

The whisky, of course, was the choice brand of The Champion Arms; the cigar he had probably brought with him from London. 

Nothing could be more dif ferent than his cynical negligence from the dapper dryness of the young American; but something in his pencil and open notebook, and perhaps in the expression of his alert blue eye, caused Kidd to guess, correctly, that he was a brother journalist. 

“Could you do me the favour,” asked Kidd, with the courtesy of his nation, “of directing me to the Grey Cottage, where Mr. 

Boulnois lives, as I under stand?” “It’s a few yards down the road,” said the red haired man, removing his cigar; “I shall be passing it myself in a minute, but I’m going on to Pendragon Park to try and see the fun.” “What is Pendragon Park?” asked Calhoun Kidd. 

279G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON “Sir Claude Champion’s place — haven’t you come down for that, too?” asked the other press man, looking up. 

“You’re a journalist, aren’t you?” “I have come to see Mr. 

Boulnois,” said Kidd. 

“I’ve come to see Mrs. 

Boulnois,” replied the oth er. 

“But I shan’t catch her at home.” And he laughed rather unpleasantly. 

“Are you interested in Catastrophism?” asked the wondering Yankee. 

“I’m interested in catastrophes; and there are go ing to be some,” replied his companion gloomily. 

“Mine’s a filthy trade, and I never pretend it isn’t.” With that he spat on the floor; yet somehow in the very act and instant one could realize that the man had been brought up as a gentleman. 

The American pressman considered him with more attention. 

His face was pale and dissipated, with the promise of formidable passions yet to be loosed; but it was a clever and sensitive face; his clothes were coarse and careless, but he had a good seal ring on one of his long, thin fingers. 

His name, which came out in the course of talk, was James Dalroy; he was the son of a bankrupt Irish landlord, and attached to a pink paper which he heartily de spised, called Smart Society, in the capacity of re porter and of something painfully like a spy. 

Smart Society, I regret to say, felt none of that in terest in Boulnois on Darwin which was such a 280THE STRANGE CRIME OF JOHN BOULNOIS credit to the head and hearts of the Western Sun. 

Dalroy had come down, it seemed, to snuff up the scent of a scandal which might very well end in the Divorce Court, but which was at present hovering between Grey Cottage and Pendragon Park. 

Sir Claude Champion was known to the readers of the Western Sun as well as Mr. 

Boulnois. 

So were the Pope and the Derby1 Winner; but the idea of their in timate acquaintanceship would have struck Kidd as equally incongruous. 

He had heard of (and written about, nay, falsely pretended to know) Sir Claude Champion, as “one of the brightest and wealthiest of England’s Upper Ten”; as the great sportsman who raced yachts round the world; as the great traveller who wrote books about the Himalayas, as the politi cian who swept constituencies with a startling sort of Tory Democracy, and as the great dabbler in art, mu sic, literature, and, above all, acting. 

Sir Claude was really rather magnificent in other than American eyes. 

There was something of the Renascence2 Prince about his omnivorous culture and restless publicity — he was not only a great amateur, but an ardent one. 

There was in him none of that antiquar ian frivolity that we convey by the word “dilettante”. 

1 Derby — Дерби — ежегодные скачки лошадей — трехлеток, проводимые в Эпсоме, близ Лондона 2 Renascence (уст.) — Renaissance — Возрождение 281G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON That faultless falcon profile with purple black Italian eye, which had been snap shotted so often both for Smart Society and the Western Sun, gave everyone the impression of a man eaten by ambition as by a fire, or even a disease. 

But though Kidd knew a great deal about Sir Claude — a great deal more, in fact, than there was to know — it would never have crossed his wildest dreams to connect so showy an aristocrat with the newly unearthed founder of Catastrophism, or to guess that Sir Claude Champion and John Boulnois could be inti mate friends. 

Such, according to Dalroy’s account, was nevertheless the fact. 

The two had hunted in couples at school and college, and, though their so cial destinies had been very different (for Champion was a great landlord and almost a millionaire, while Boulnois was a poor scholar and, until just lately, an unknown one), they still kept in very close touch with each other. 

Indeed, Boulnois’s cottage stood just outside the gates of Pendragon Park. 

But whether the two men could be friends much longer was becoming a dark and ugly question. 

A year or two before, Boulnois had married a beau tiful and not unsuccessful actress, to whom he was devoted in his own shy and ponderous style; and the proximity of the household to Champion’s had giv en that flighty celebrity opportunities for behaving in a way that could not but cause painful and rather 282THE STRANGE CRIME OF JOHN BOULNOIS base excitement. 

Sir Claude had carried the arts of publicity to perfection; and he seemed to take a cra zy pleasure in being equally ostentatious in an in trigue that could do him no sort of honour. 

Foot men from Pendragon were perpetually leaving bou quets for Mrs. 

Boulnois; carriages and motor cars were perpetually calling at the cottage for Mrs. 

Boulnois; balls and masquerades perpetually filled the grounds in which the baronet paraded Mrs. 

Boulnois, like the Queen of Love and Beauty at a tournament. 

That very evening, marked by Mr. 

Kidd for the exposition of Catastrophism, had been marked by Sir Claude Champion for an open air rendering of Romeo and Juliet1, in which he was to play Romeo to a Juliet it was needless to name. 

“I don’t think it can go on without a smash,” said the young man with red hair, getting up and shak ing himself. 

“Old Boulnois may be squared — or he may be square. 

But if he’s square he’s thick — what you might call cubic. 

But I don’t believe it’s possi ble.” “He is a man of grand intellectual powers,” said Calhoun Kidd in a deep voice. 

“Yes,” answered Dalroy; “but even a man of grand intellectual powers can’t be such a blighted 1 Romeo and Juliet — см.

K. 

CHESTERTON fool as all that. 

Must you be going on? I shall be fol lowing myself in a minute or two.” But Calhoun Kidd, having finished a milk and soda, betook himself smartly up the road towards the Grey Cottage, leaving his cynical informant to his whisky and tobacco. 

The last of the daylight had faded; the skies were of a dark, green grey, like slate, studded here and there with a star, but lighter on the left side of the sky, with the promise of a ris ing moon. 

The Grey Cottage, which stood entrenched, as it were, in a square of stiff, high thorn hedges, was so close under the pines and palisades of the Park that Kidd at first mistook it for the Park Lodge. 

Finding the name on the narrow wooden gate, however, and seeing by his watch that the hour of the “Thinker’s” appointment had just struck, he went in and knocked at the front door. 

Inside the garden hedge, he could see that the house, though unpretentious enough, was larger and more luxurious than it looked at first, and was quite a different kind of place from a porter’s lodge. 

A dog kennel and a beehive stood outside, like symbols of old English country life; the moon was rising behind a planta tion of prosperous pear trees, the dog that came out of the kennel was reverend looking and reluctant to bark; and the plain, elderly man servant who opened the door was brief but dignified. 

284THE STRANGE CRIME OF JOHN BOULNOIS “Mr. 

Boulnois asked me to offer his apologies, sir,” he said, “but he has been obliged to go out suddenly.” “But see here, I had an appointment,” said the interviewer, with a rising voice. 

“Do you know where he went to?” “To Pendragon Park, sir,” said the servant, rather sombrely, and began to close the door. 

Kidd started a little. 

“Did he go with Mrs. 

Boulnois — with the rest of the party?” he asked rather vaguely. 

“No, sir,” said the man shortly; “he stayed be hind, and then went out alone.” And he shut the door, brutally, but with an air of duty not done. 

The American, that curious compound of impu dence and sensitiveness, was annoyed. 

He felt a strong desire to hustle them all along a bit and teach them business habits; the hoary old dog and the grizzled, heavy faced old butler with his prehistoric shirt front, and the drowsy old moon, and above all the scatter brained old philosopher who couldn’t keep an appointment. 

“If that’s the way he goes on he deserves to lose his wife’s purest devotion,” said Mr. 

Calhoun Kidd. 

“But perhaps he’s gone over to make a row. 

In that case I reckon a man from the Western Sun will be on the spot.” And turning the corner by the open lodge gates, he set off, stumping up the long avenue of black 285G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON pine woods that pointed in abrupt perspective to wards the inner gardens of Pendragon Park. 

The trees were as black and orderly as plumes upon a hearse; there were still a few stars. 

He was a man with more literary than direct natural associations; the word “Ravenswood” came into his head repeat edly. 

It was partly the raven colour of the pine woods; but partly also an indescribable atmosphere almost described in Scott’s great tragedy; the smell of something that died in the eighteenth century; the smell of dank gardens and broken urns, of wrongs that will never now be righted; of something that is none the less incurably sad because it is strangely unreal. 

More than once, as he went up that strange, black road of tragic artifice, he stopped, startled, thinking he heard steps in front of him. 

He could see nothing in front but the twin sombre walls of pine and the wedge of starlit sky above them. 

At first he thought he must have fancied it or been mocked by a mere echo of his own tramp. 

But as he went on he was more and more inclined to conclude, with the remains of his reason, that there really were other feet upon the road. 

He thought hazily of ghosts; and was surprised how swiftly he could see the image of an appropriate and local ghost, one with a face as white as Pierrot’s, but patched with black. 

The apex of the triangle of dark blue sky was 286THE STRANGE CRIME OF JOHN BOULNOIS growing brighter and bluer, but he did not realize as yet that this was because he was coming nearer to the lights of the great house and garden. 

He only felt that the atmosphere was growing more intense, there was in the sadness more violence and secre cy — more — he hesitated for the word, and then said it with a jerk of laughter — Catastrophism. 

More pines, more pathway slid past him, and then he stood rooted as by a blast of magic. 

It is vain to say that he felt as if he had got into a dream; but this time he felt quite certain that he had got into a book. 

For we human beings are used to inappropri ate things; we are accustomed to the clatter of the incongruous; it is a tune to which we can go to sleep. 

If one appropriate thing happens, it wakes us up like the pang of a perfect chord. 

Something hap pened such as would have happened in such a place in a forgotten tale. 

Over the black pine wood came flying and flash ing in the moon a naked sword — such a slender and sparkling rapier as may have fought many an unjust duel in that ancient park. 

It fell on the pathway far in front of him and lay there glistening like a large needle. 

He ran like a hare and bent to look at it. 

Seen at close quarters it had rather a showy look: the big red jewels in the hilt and guard were a little dubious. 

But there were other red drops upon the blade which were not dubious. 

287G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON He looked round wildly in the direction from which the dazzling missile had come, and saw that at this point the sable façade of fir and pine was in terrupted by a smaller road at right angles; which, when he turned it, brought him in full view of the long, lighted house, with a lake and fountains in front of it. 

Nevertheless, he did not look at this, having something more interesting to look at. 

Above him, at the angle of the steep green bank of the terraced garden, was one of those small pic turesque surprises common in the old landscape gardening; a kind of small round hill or dome of grass, like a giant mole hill, ringed and crowned with three concentric fences of roses, and having a sundial in the highest point in the centre. 

Kidd could see the finger of the dial stand up dark against the sky like the dorsal fin of a shark and the vain moonlight clinging to that idle clock. 

But he saw something else clinging to it also, for one wild mo ment — the figure of a man. 

Though he saw it there only for a moment, though it was outlandish and incredible in costume, being clad from neck to heel in tight crimson, with glints of gold, yet he knew in one flash of moonlight who it was. 

That white face flung up to heaven, clean shaven and so unnaturally young, like Byron1 1 Byron — Джордж Ноэл Гордон Байрон (1788–1824), английский поэт романтик, член палаты лордов 288THE STRANGE CRIME OF JOHN BOULNOIS with a Roman nose, those black curls already griz zled — he had seen the thousand public portraits of Sir Claude Champion. 

The wild red figure reeled an instant against the sundial; the next it had rolled down the steep bank and lay at the American’s feet, faintly moving one arm. 

A gaudy, unnatural gold ornament on the arm suddenly reminded Kidd of Romeo and Juliet; of course the tight crimson suit was part of the play. 

But there was a long red stain down the bank from which the man had rolled — that was no part of the play. 

He had been run through the body. 

Mr. 

Calhoun Kidd shouted and shouted again. 

Once more he seemed to hear phantasmal footsteps, and started to find another figure already near him. 

He knew the figure, and yet it terrified him. 

The dis sipated youth who had called himself Dalroy had a horribly quiet way with him; if Boulnois failed to keep appointments that had been made, Dalroy had a sinister air of keeping appointments that hadn’t. 

The moonlight discoloured everything, against Dal roy’s red hair his wan face looked not so much white as pale green. 

All this morbid impressionism must be Kidd’s excuse for having cried out, brutally and beyond all reason: “Did you do this, you devil?” James Dalroy smiled his unpleasing smile; but be fore he could speak, the fallen figure made another 289G.

“Boulnois ...

he threw it...” Again the failing hand waved towards the sword, and then fell rigid with a thud. 

In Kidd rose from its depth all that acrid humour that is the strange salt of the seriousness of his race. 

“See here,” he said sharply and with command, “you must fetch a doctor. 

This man’s dead.” “And a priest, too, I suppose,” said Dalroy in an undecipherable manner. 

“All these Champions are papists.” The American knelt down by the body, felt the heart, propped up the head and used some last ef forts at restoration; but before the other journalist reappeared, followed by a doctor and a priest, he was already prepared to assert they were too late. 

“Were you too late also?” asked the doctor, a sol id prosperous looking man, with conventional moustache and whiskers, but a lively eye, which darted over Kidd dubiously. 

“In one sense,” drawled the representative of the Sun. 

“I was too late to save the man, but I guess I 290THE STRANGE CRIME OF JOHN BOULNOIS was in time to hear something of importance. 

I heard the dead man denounce his assassin.” “And who was the assassin?” asked the doctor, drawing his eyebrows together. 

“Boulnois,” said Calhoun Kidd, and whistled softly. 

The doctor stared at him gloomily with a redden ing brow — but he did not contradict. 

Then the priest, a shorter figure in the background, said mildly: “I understood that Mr. 

Boulnois was not coming to Pendragon Park this evening.” “There again,” said the Yankee grimly, “I may be in a position to give the old country a fact or two. 

Yes, sir, John Boulnois was going to stay in all this evening; he fixed up a real good appointment there with me. 

But John Boulnois changed his mind; John Boulnois left his home abruptly and all alone, and came over to this darned Park an hour or so ago. 

His butler told me so. 

I think we hold what the all wise police call a clue — have you sent for them?” “Yes,” said the doctor, “but we haven’t alarmed anyone else yet.” “Does Mrs. 

Boulnois know?” asked James Dal roy, and again Kidd was conscious of an irrational desire to hit him on his curling mouth. 

“I have not told her,” said the doctor gruffly; “but here come the police.” The little priest had stepped out into the main avenue, and now returned with the fallen sword, 291G. 

K. 

CHESTERTON which looked ludicrously large and theatrical when attached to his dumpy figure, at once clerical and commonplace. 

“Just before the police come,” he said apologetically, “has anyone got a light?” The Yankee journalist took an electric torch from his pocket, and the priest held it close to the middle part of the blade, which he examined with blinking care. 

Then, without glancing at the point or pom mel, he handed the long weapon to the doctor. 

“I fear I’m no use here,” he said, with a brief sigh. 

“I’ll say good night to you, gentlemen.” And he walked away up the dark avenue towards the house, his hands clasped behind him and his big head bent in cogitation. 

The rest of the group made increased haste to wards the lodge gates, where an inspector and two constables could already be seen in consultation with the lodge keeper. 

But the little priest only walked slower and slower in the dim cloister of pine, and at last stopped dead, on the steps of the house. 

It was his silent way of acknowledging an equally si lent approach; for there came towards him a pres ence that might have satisfied even Calhoun Kidd’s demands for a lovely and aristocratic ghost. 

It was a young woman in silvery satins of a Renascence de sign; she had golden hair in two long shining ropes, and a face so startingly pale between them that she might have been chryselephantine — made, that is, 292THE STRANGE CRIME OF JOHN BOULNOIS like some old Greek statues, out of ivory and gold. 

But her eyes were very bright, and her voice, though low, was confident. 

“Father Brown?” she said. 

“Mrs. 

Boulnois?” he replied gravely. 

Then he looked at her and immediately said: “I see you know about Sir Claude.” “How do you know I know?” she asked steadily. 

He did not answer the question, but asked an other: “Have you seen your husband?” “My husband is at home,” she said. 

“He has nothing to do with this.” Again he did not answer; and the woman drew nearer to him, with a curiously intense expression on her face. 

“Shall I tell you something more?” she said, with a rather fearful smile. 

“I don’t think he did it, and you don’t either.” Father Brown returned her gaze with a long, grave stare, and then nodded, yet more gravely. 

“Father Brown,” said the lady, “I am going to tell you all I know, but I want you to do me a favour first. 

Will you tell me why you haven’t jumped to the conclusion of poor John’s guilt, as all the rest have done? Don’t mind what you say: I — I know about the gossip and the appearances that are against me.” Father Brown looked honestly embarrassed, and passed his hand across his forehead. 

“Two very little things,” he said.

We can direct our moral wills; but we can’t generally change our in stinctive tastes and ways of doing things. 

Boulnois might commit a murder, but not this murder. 

He would not snatch Romeo’s sword from its romantic scabbard; or slay his foe on the sundial as on a kind of altar; or leave his body among the roses, or fling the sword away among the pines. 

If Boulnois killed anyone he’d do it quietly and heavily, as he’d do any other doubtful thing — take a tenth glass of port, or read a loose Greek poet. 

No, the romantic setting is not like Boulnois. 

It’s more like Champion.” “Ah!” she said, and looked at him with eyes like diamonds. 

“And the trivial thing was this,” said Brown. 

“There were finger prints on that sword; finger 294THE STRANGE CRIME OF JOHN BOULNOIS prints can be detected quite a time after they are made if they’re on some polished surface like glass or steel. 

These were on a polished surface. 

They were half way down the blade of the sword. 

Whose prints they were I have no earthly clue; but why should anybody hold a sword half way down? It was a long sword, but length is an advantage in lunging at an enemy. 

At least, at most enemies. 

At all ene mies except one.” “Except one,” she repeated. 

“There is only one enemy,” said Father Brown, “whom it is easier to kill with a dagger than a sword.” “I know,” said the woman. 

“Oneself.” There was a long silence, and then the priest said quietly but abruptly: “Am I right, then? Did Sir Claude kill himself?” “Yes” she said, with a face like marble. 

“I saw him do it.” “He died,” said Father Brown, “for love of you?” An extraordinary expression flashed across her face, very different from pity, modesty, remorse, or anything her companion had expected: her voice became suddenly strong and full. 

“I don’t believe,” she said, “he ever cared about me a rap. 

He hated my husband.” “Why?” asked the other, and turned his round face from the sky to the lady.

.” “Yes?” said Brown patiently. 

“Because my husband wouldn’t hate him.” Father Brown only nodded, and seemed still to be listening; he differed from most detectives in fact and fiction in a small point — he never pretended not to understand when he understood perfectly well. 

Mrs. 

Boulnois drew near once more with the same contained glow of certainty. 

“My husband,” she said, “is a great man. 

Sir Claude Champion was not a great man: he was a celebrated and successful man. 

My husband has never been celebrated or suc cessful; and it is the solemn truth that he has never dreamed of being so. 

He no more expects to be fa mous for thinking than for smoking cigars. 

On all that side he has a sort of splendid stupidity. 

He has never grown up. 

He still liked Champion exactly as he liked him at school; he admired him as he would admire a conjuring trick done at the dinner table. 

But he couldn’t be got to conceive the notion of en vying Champion. 

And Champion wanted to be en vied. 

He went mad and killed himself for that.” “Yes,” said Father Brown; “I think I begin to un derstand.” “Oh, don’t you see?” she cried; “the whole pic ture is made for that — the place is planned for it. 

296THE STRANGE CRIME OF JOHN BOULNOIS Champion put John in a little house at his very door, like a dependant — to make him feel a failure. 

He never felt it. 

He thinks no more about such things than — than an absent minded lion. 

Champion would burst in on John’s shabbiest hours or homeli est meals with some dazzling present or announce ment or expedition that made it like the visit of Ha roun Alraschid1, and John would accept or refuse amiably with one eye off, so to speak, like one lazy schoolboy agreeing or disagreeing with another. 

Af ter five years of it John had not turned a hair2; and Sir Claude Champion was a monomaniac.” “And Haman began to tell them,” said Father Brown, “of all the things wherein the king had hon oured him; and he said: ‘All these things profit me nothing while I see Mordecai the Jew sitting in the gate.’” “The crisis came,” Mrs. 

Boulnois continued, “when I persuaded John to let me take down some of his speculations and send them to a magazine. 

They began to attract attention, especially in Ameri ca, and one paper wanted to interview him.

K. 

CHESTERTON heard of this late little crumb of success falling to his unconscious rival, the last link snapped that held back his devilish hatred. 

Then he began to lay that insane siege to my own love and honour which has been the talk of the shire. 

You will ask me why I al lowed such atrocious attentions. 

I answer that I could not have declined them except by explaining to my husband, and there are some things the soul cannot do, as the body cannot fly. 

Nobody could have explained to my husband. 

Nobody could do it now. 

If you said to him in so many words, ‘Champi on is stealing your wife,’ he would think the joke a little vulgar: that it could be anything but a joke — that notion could find no crack in his great skull to get in by. 

Well, John was to come and see us act this evening, but just as we were starting he said he wouldn’t; he had got an interesting book and a ci gar. 

I told this to Sir Claude, and it was his death blow. 

The monomaniac suddenly saw despair. 

He stabbed himself, crying out like a devil that Boul nois was slaying him; he lies there in the garden dead of his own jealousy to produce jealousy, and John is sitting in the dining room reading a book.” There was another silence, and then the little priest said: “There is only one weak point, Mrs. 

Boulnois, in all your very vivid account. 

Your husband is not sitting in the dining room reading a book. 

That American reporter told me he had been 298THE STRANGE CRIME OF JOHN BOULNOIS to your house, and your butler told him Mr. 

Boul nois had gone to Pendragon Park after all.” Her bright eyes widened to an almost electric glare; and yet it seemed rather bewilderment than confusion or fear. 

“Why, what can you mean?” she cried. 

“All the servants were out of the house, seeing the theatricals. 

And we don’t keep a butler, thank goodness!” Father Brown started and spun half round like an absurd teetotum. 

“What, what?” he cried seeming galvanized into sudden life. 

“Look here — I say — can I make your husband hear if I go to the house?” “Oh, the servants will be back by now,” she said, wondering. 

“Right, right!” rejoined the cleric energetically, and set off scuttling up the path towards the Park gates. 

He turned once to say: “Better get hold of that Yankee, or ‘Crime of John Boulnois’ will be all over the Republic in large letters.” “You don’t understand,” said Mrs. 

Boulnois. 

“He wouldn’t mind. 

I don’t think he imagines that America really is a place.” When Father Brown reached the house with the beehive and the drowsy dog, a small and neat maid servant showed him into the dining room, where Boulnois sat reading by a shaded lamp, exactly as his wife described him. 

A decanter of port and a wineglass were at his elbow; and the instant the 299G.

CHESTERTON priest entered he noted the long ash stand out un broken on his cigar. 

“He has been here for half an hour at least,” thought Father Brown. 

In fact, he had the air of sitting where he had sat when his dinner was cleared away. 

“Don’t get up, Mr Boulnois,” said the priest in his pleasant, prosaic way. 

“I shan’t interrupt you a moment. 

I fear I break in on some of your scientific studies.” “No,” said Boulnois; “I was reading ‘The Bloody Thumb’.” He said it with neither frown nor smile, and his visitor was conscious of a certain deep and virile indifference in the man which his wife had called greatness. 

He laid down a gory yellow “shocker” without even feeling its incongruity enough to comment on it humorously. 

John Boul nois was a big, slow moving man with a massive head, partly grey and partly bald, and blunt, burly features. 

He was in shabby and very old fashioned evening dress, with a narrow triangular opening of shirt front: he had assumed it that evening in his original purpose of going to see his wife act Juliet. 

“I won’t keep you long from ‘The Bloody Thumb’ or any other catastrophic affairs,” said Father Brown, smiling. 

“I only came to ask you about the crime you committed this evening.” Boulnois looked at him steadily, but a red bar be gan to show across his broad brow; and he seemed 3001 THE STRANGE CRIME OF JOHN BOULNOIS like one discovering embarrassment for the first time. 

“I know it was a strange crime,” assented Brown in a low voice. 

“Stranger than murder perhaps — to you. 

The little sins are sometimes harder to confess than the big ones — but that’s why it’s so important to confess them. 

Your crime is committed by every fashionable hostess six times a week: and yet you find it sticks to your tongue like a nameless atroci ty.” “It makes one feel,” said the philosopher slowly, “such a damned fool.” “I know,” assented the other, “but one often has to choose between feeling a damned fool and being one.” “I can’t analyse myself well,” went on Boulnois; “but sitting in that chair with that story I was as happy as a schoolboy on a half holiday. 

It was secu rity, eternity — I can’t convey it...

K. 

CHESTERTON I opened the front door, and there was a little man with his mouth open to speak and his notebook open to write in. 

I remembered the Yankee inter viewer I had forgotten. 

His hair was parted in the middle, and I tell you that murder — ” “I understand,” said Father Brown. 

“I’ve seen him.” “I didn’t commit murder,” continued the Cata strophist mildly, “but only perjury. 

I said I had gone across to Pendragon Park and shut the door in his face. 

That is my crime, Father Brown, and I don’t know what penance you would inflict for it.” “I shan’t inflict any penance,” said the clerical gentleman, collecting his heavy hat and umbrella with an air of some amusement; “quite the contra ry1. 

I came here specially to let you off the little pen ance which would otherwise have followed your lit tle offence.” “And what,” asked Boulnois, smiling, “is the little penance I have so luckily been let off?” “Being hanged,” said Father Brown.
